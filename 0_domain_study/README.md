## 🧩 Summary of the Problem Statement

Mental health apps serve as a vital entry point to emotional support, especially
in regions where traditional services are limited by cost, stigma, or
availability. Our project focuses on comparing **user-perceived support quality**
across three models:

- 🤖 Chatbot-based
- 🧑‍⚕️ Human-based
- 🔁 Hybrid systems

We explore how users across different cultural contexts experience empathy,
trust, and effectiveness in each model—and what that means for building
equitable, responsive digital health tools.
