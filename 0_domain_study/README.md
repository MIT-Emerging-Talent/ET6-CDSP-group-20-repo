# 🧠 Domain Study – Chatbot vs Human vs Hybrid Support in Mental Health Apps

Welcome to the domain research space for our collaborative data science project.
This folder gathers the foundational work that helps us understand the  
**landscape of digital mental health support**, particularly across  
**chatbot, human, and hybrid models**.

## 📌 Project Overview

📌 Our Story

  Our team explored multiple domains before deciding to focus on mental health
  apps. We made this choice using a structured evaluation matrix, considering
  factors like societal relevance, data availability, and potential impact.

Mental health apps are increasingly used to fill gaps in traditional care,
offering support through:

🤖 AI chat-bots

🧑‍⚕️ Human in-app support

🔁 Hybrid systems combining both

We want to understand how users experience these platforms emotionally and
culturally. Our goal is to explore trust, empathy, and perceived effectiveness
in digital mental health support.

## Why This Matters

Mental health is a critical global issue, yet access to traditional care is
limited. Digital platforms provide a scalable solution, but how users perceive
these supports is still under-explored.

* By studying mental health apps, we aim to:

  * Identify gaps in emotional support
  * Understand user preferences and experiences
  * Inform better design and evaluation of mental health tools

Existing research gives some insights, but many questions remain—especially
about chatbot vs. human support in diverse cultural contexts.

---

## Identified Problems

* Users’ emotional experiences with chat-bots are not fully understood

* Limited data exists on the quality of support in hybrid systems

* The effectiveness of digital mental health support varies across cultures and
  regions

## Research Question

Originally, we aimed to compare Chatbot vs Human: Support Quality in Mental
Health Apps.

Due to privacy considerations, we reframed our question:
"How do users emotionally perceive chatbot support in mental health apps?"

This keeps the focus on user experiences while respecting privacy constraints.
