# 🧠 Domain Study – Chatbot vs Human vs Hybrid Support in Mental Health Apps

Welcome to the domain research space for our collaborative data science project.
This folder gathers the foundational work that helps us understand the  
**landscape of digital mental health support**, particularly across  
**chatbot, human, and hybrid models**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Mental health apps are increasingly used to fill gaps in traditional care.  
These platforms often rely on:

- 🤖 AI-driven **chatbots**  
- 🧑‍⚕️ In-app **human support**  
- 🔁 **Hybrid systems** that blend both

Our team is investigating how users experience these models—emotionally,  
culturally, and practically—across different regions. We’ll use natural  
language processing, sentiment analysis, and real user data to explore  
perceptions of trust, empathy, and effectiveness in digital mental health platforms.

This folder helps anchor that work.
