# Constraints for Milestone 1: Problem Identification

As part of Milestone 1, our team has identified key constraints for our project
focused on improving mental health app accessibility. Please review and provide
feedback to refine these constraints for the next steps.

## Constraints

- **Available Data**: Access to real chat logs is limited due to privacy and data
  ownership concerns, impacting dataset availability for analysis.
- **Domain Expertise**: Evaluating support quality requires clinical psychology
  expertise, which our team may lack.
- **CS/DS Expertise**: Building NLP models (e.g., sentiment analysis) demands
  strong DS/ML skills, challenging for some team members.
- **Remote Async Collaboration**: Asynchronous work across time zones creates
  communication and coordination challenges.
- **Milestone Pacing**: Balancing deliverable quality with fixed deadlines risks
  rushed outputs.
- **Evaluation Criteria Ambiguity**: Defining "quality" in mental health support
  (e.g., empathy, accuracy, response time) remains unclear.

## Next Steps

- Discuss potential solutions or mitigations for each constraint.
- Identify resources (e.g., public datasets, expert consultations) to address
  limitations.
- Propose evaluation criteria for "quality" in mental health support.

Please share your thoughts or suggestions by [date, e.g., June 20, 2025] to
inform our Milestone 2 planning.
