# Research Initiatives: Exploring Critical Global Challenges

  This repository outlines a series of research projects aimed at investigating
  pressing societal, economic, and health challenges. Each project is defined by
  a core research question, with the overarching goal of generating insights that
  can inform policy, practice, and further academic inquiry.

## **Research Questions**

Below are the key research questions guiding our various investigations:

1. **[The "Credential Inflation" Trap:](https://tinyurl.com/3m5e9tkm)**

   Companies are increasingly requiring a 4-year college degree for jobs that,
   until recently, did not need one. This practice locks out millions of skilled
   and experienced individuals who lack a formal degree, while forcing others
   into unnecessary debt. It creates a system where a credential is valued more
   than demonstrated ability.

2. **[Loneliness Epidemic in the Gig Economy:](https://tinyurl.com/3m5e9tkm)**

   The Core Problem: Companies are increasingly requiring a 4-year college degree
   for jobs that, until recently, did not need one. This practice locks out
   millions of skilled and experienced individuals who lack a formal degree,
   while forcing others into unnecessary debt. It creates a system where a
   credential is valued more than demonstrated ability.

3. **[The "Food Waste Paradox":](https://tinyurl.com/24hwtvtj)**

   The Core Problem: Companies are increasingly requiring a 4-year college degree
   for jobs that, until recently, did not need one. This practice locks out
   millions of skilled and experienced individuals who lack a formal degree,
   while forcing others into unnecessary debt. It creates a system where a
   credential is valued more than demonstrated ability.

4. **[Fast Food & Child Health:](https://tinyurl.com/5n9643mn)**

   What are the long-term negative health and developmental effects on children
   who consume large amounts of fast food regularly?

5. **[Chatbot vs Human: Support Quality in Mental Health Apps:](https://tinyurl.com/mcn3k6fc)**

   HMany mental health apps today rely on chat-bots to deliver emotional support.
   These AI-driven agents are available 24/7, cost-effective, and scalable—but
   are they actually helpful?

6. **[Displaced People in Conflict Zones (Mental Health):](https://tinyurl.com/3yjyd633)**

   Displaced people in conflict zones (like Gaza, Syria) face high rates of
   untreated mental health issues—such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression—due to
   trauma, instability, and lack of services.

7. **[Adolescent Girls Miss School During Menstruation:](https://tinyurl.com/vuppu3zf)**

   The Core Problem: Companies are increasingly requiring a 4-year college degree
   for jobs that, until recently, did not need one. This practice locks out
   millions of skilled and experienced individuals who lack a formal degree,
   while forcing others into unnecessary debt. It creates a system where a
   credential is valued more than demonstrated ability.

8. **[Economic Factors and Violence Correlation:](https://tinyurl.com/ye2zbsr3)**

   Violent incidents such as protests, riots, and attacks don’t occur evenly
   across regions. Some states or provinces experience higher frequencies or more
   severe events than others. But why?

9. **[Unspoken Gaps: Menstrual Health Access in Asia:](https://tinyurl.com/4r45m9kn)**

     In several parts of Asia, girls lack access to menstrual hygiene products,
     safe toilets, or accurate education — causing school absenteeism, stigma,
     and health risks.

10. **[Regional Security Differences:](https://tinyurl.com/ye2zbsr3)**

    Violent incidents such as protests, riots, and attacks don’t occur evenly
    across regions. Some states or provinces experience higher frequencies or
    more severe events than others. But why?

## 2. [Evaluation Framework](https://tinyurl.com/3r5a5jee)

  Each research project is evaluated by team members based on a set of core
  criteria to ensure rigor, relevance, and impact. Our evaluation framework
  considers the following aspects, each scored on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being
  the highest):

- **Problem Impact (1-5):** The significance and urgency of the problem the
    research addresses.
- **Data Feasibility (1-5):** The realistic availability and accessibility of
    data required to conduct the research.
- **Team Passion (1-5):** The level of enthusiasm and personal investment of the
    team members in the topic.
- **Technical Scope (1-5):** The appropriateness and manageability of the
    technical complexity involved.
- **Final Artifact Potential (1-5):** The potential for the research to produce a
    meaningful and impactful output (e.g., report, dashboard, intervention).
- **Originality & "Wow" Factor (1-5):** The novelty of the idea and its potential
    to generate surprising or significant insights.
