A Google user,"lately this app fails to open first time I get the message ""calm is not responding"" so frustrating from the start, also this app is too quiet . Even on full I have to have my phone quite near to hear it. The daily Jay especially? Headphones aren't always wanted. No problem with my other apps only this one 🤔",2,2025-08-23 14:45:26
A Google user,"Literally nothing free in this app , useless",1,2025-08-22 05:40:46
A Google user,whats the use of it if everything is locked behind a paywall.,1,2025-08-21 17:28:48
A Google user,Meh. Everything's locked. Not worth it either way,1,2025-08-21 15:19:33
A Google user,I really enjoy the app but I have it a 2 due to not allowing me to have my account on two different devices. I would give it a 5 if it allowed me and I didn't have to pay for it to be on each device.,2,2025-08-21 04:03:22
A Google user,pretty much useless unless you are willing to pay. only gives 3 listens and then you only get a few options to choose from. extremely disappointed.,2,2025-08-20 17:02:01
A Google user,Took a 7 day free trial on 12th August and was told I'd get a reminder my trial was ending 2 days before it ended. No reminder sent and billed me for 12 months (£49.99) on 19th August.........5 days after starting the trial! That is theft in my eyes..........disgusting!!,1,2025-08-20 16:57:58
A Google user,"They already lock off 95% of the app if you don't pay a subscription, and they've now went and locked off the vast majority of what was remaining. Totally put me off of paying for the steep subscription price and will be looking elsewhere for a sleep app.",1,2025-08-20 14:41:28
A Google user,helps me so much with my anxiety and sleeplessness thank you. UPDATE!!!! TRIED TO PAY AND REALIZED THE PRICE HAS WENT UP. SO I'M NO LONGER DOING CALM!! Not everyone can afford that much.,2,2025-08-20 10:39:09

A Google user,I have lived Calm for years. But now they don't put our new slept stories very often. I listen to Calm stories every night & it would be nice to have something new now & then.,2,2025-08-20 06:26:39
A Google user,I haven't found the meditations or music to be ask calming as what I can find on YouTube for free.,3,2025-08-18 22:24:54
A Google user,I have used the app on and off for a while. The offering was ok for the money but nothing special. Today I received an email stating that my subscription renewal would go up by 25% next month. that's not an increase inline witht anythng I'm a ware of. Subscription has been cancelled and have downloaded an alternative app.,1,2025-08-18 06:45:37
A Google user,I don't like that you have to pay monthly so I deleted the app,1,2025-08-18 03:22:42

A Google user,"can't cancel free trial. it doesn't appear in Google play to be able to cancel free trial, I have tried doing it through the web to no avail and there's no way to talk to anyone so now my anxiety is through the roof because I can't afford the subscription!!",1,2025-08-15 18:49:25
A Google user,Does have a good variety of content to choose from. Some of the sleep stories are a bit too long though. Also the app glitches when logging in for a couple of minutes but usually is fine after that.,3,2025-08-15 03:32:20
A Google user,need to login even to try it,1,2025-08-14 13:45:29
A Google user,I love the options available for my child but I won't purchase again after my current subscription ends because I can't play it on her Amazon speaker. Really disappointed.,3,2025-08-14 10:27:31
A Google user,"I am so sad. The day finally came. I have been listening to ""The Waterfall"" for years. I can almost quote it to you. They charged for all the other ones, but that one remained free and I remained so grateful. I cant quite afford a membership yet. but hopefully I'll be back... until then😢💔",3,2025-08-14 10:00:09

A Google user,"can not apply discount code as app says I have premium, but app says I have no subscription, confusing being sent between Android appand website plus verification of account not working as it does not send a text message to my DK phone number, all in all this app is not helping me find serenity but is confusing and annoying.",1,2025-08-10 11:32:50
A Google user,i don't understand why i cannot: 1. manage/delete individual douwnloaded files in the app 2. play downloaded meditations while I am on a flight mode (without connecting to the server??? for what??),1,2025-08-09 15:08:12

A Google user,"app is generally good but the movement videos are not loading on my phone or my tablet so pretty disappointed about that. no direct support either, just automated garbage which is equally frustrating. Not very calm currently.",3,2025-08-09 02:39:38
A Google user,"This is the 3rd time I downloaded this app and I have the same issue every time: I haven't figured out a single free thing I can do in this app. everything seems to have a lock on it and I definitely won't pay for something I haven't tried. I also haven't been able to figure out if they do student discounts in the UK. I will stick to Headspace (which is £7.99/YEAR for students.) For something that should help with anxiety, this is very anxiety inducing.",2,2025-08-08 10:10:04
A Google user,lying pos is NOT free after 7 days,1,2025-08-08 05:13:37
A Google user,I liked Calm for their sleep stories but they have really sucked over the past year. Trying a new app to replace Calm because it doesn't appear they have any interest in approving. Headspace seems to be a good replacement,1,2025-08-08 02:37:49

A Google user,"I have been using ( and paying for )this app for about two years. I really do enjoy it, but it lacks some basic features to make it 5 🌟. First, they claim you can download things to listen offline, but it does not work. at least it does not work on a Samsung S24. Second, you can't sort stories by narrator. Adding this would make the app much more user friendly.",3,2025-08-06 14:31:25
A Google user,great app with lots o useful practices. was paying around 7.99 a month. suddenly the app reset and started charging £18.99 a month. obviously to expensive to justify. might as well go to a professional for that money.,3,2025-08-06 10:22:11
A Google user,Downloaded it just to try because the description said there were some series that were available to everyone and there's almost nothing that isn't locked behind premium. The only thing I even saw that wasn't locked was the sound of rain or something. Not a great first impression.,1,2025-08-06 04:22:55

A Google user,"I used to use the free version all the time, only using the Thunderscape sleep sounds, it used to be free, so I used it regularly, now I have to pay a subscription for a sound I previously never had before. It said I had used up my ""3 free listens"" let me assure you reader. I listened to that a *lot* more than 3 times, again, because it was a free sound. But, now I can't without paying for a subscription, so, I've uninstalled the app and will be looking elsewhere for a similar product.",1,2025-08-05 07:59:01
A Google user,"sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and sometimes when it's working it just stops and has to be restarted, it's very frustrating",2,2025-08-05 06:27:53
A Google user,"I used to love the app years ago. I was not in a good place so in a weak moment I paid for the app and this helped me through it. these days I'm struggling again and it's heartbreaking to see that the app has gotten even more expensive. so while we all struggle with mental health, the developer and Tamara are laughing all the way to the bank. Guys just use the ""Insight Timer"" app. It's literally recommended by psychologists and therapists",2,2025-08-04 12:46:25
A Google user,"They're aggressively advertising their discounts or gifts for your friends in the paid version. Almost all content has some kind of mention of stressors, descriptions of how awful you might feel and trying to symapthize with your current bad situation, but almost none relate to my situation. I really don't like hearing about hardships in a paid app which is supposed to help me relax and meditate. Although the intention might be legit, they didn't help users find the content that suits them.",2,2025-08-04 09:47:27

A Google user,"Reduced from five stars because they've destroyed the app with incredibly annoying attempts to gamify it's usage. I don't want ""streaks"", I don't want viral loops, I want an app that doesn't freeze, crash or bamboozle with innane pop ups pushing specific usage patterns. They have spent all their time making an app called ""Calm"" utterly stressful to use.",1,2025-07-31 02:00:43
A Google user,"Requires high speed internet to download content. I don't have fast internet or an income so I can't use this app. Also, Vivaldi loads way too slowly with slow internet.

A Google user,uninstalled app today after receiving no support. The company I work for provides a premium account and it will not allow me to log in. It's asking me to enter a password that I never chose and have no way of knowing. there's no phone number or email address and the AI chat claims It is going to connect you to a live person but it just asks endless redundant questions.

A Google user,The affects on my dogs are adequate and i would say it does calm them to a point. the limited public domain music in constant repition is annoying but tolerable.

This choice could be made during install only or on some time based use. i.e. once a month or every 20 or so starts. I would also like to see a limited free trail of the premium,3,2025-07-10 16:37:04

There isn't a lot there for those who do pay & I'd be pretty unhappy if I were them & realised I could get a lot of the content free elsewhere.

A Google user,"1 star minimum is gratuitous. Not advertised as a paid only app. Do not download unless you want to pay $70 a year for something finicky, according to reviews. A free trial without HAVING to add a CC would be optimal.",1,2023-11-25 08:59:10
A Google user,I'm always fighting with the app because the app when the screen goes off I have to restart everything due to restrictions on the app. I'm always jumping up to start the app over with storytime for the kids and meditation. It's really frustrating when you got the best stories for kids and running to make shure its still on every 5 minutes! I feel like I paid for stress now.,1,2023-11-25 04:38:40
A Google user,what a horrible app.,1,2023-11-25 00:27:46
A Google user,"Has some nice meditations (e.g. Jeff Warren's content). I used for 1-2 months, but there's not more beyond that. The app itself and its UI are not great, and it looks rough around the edges. The search is very bad, hard to find even meditations whose names I knew! The library itself is bloated with a lot of unnecessary content (e.g. soundscapes and sleep stories). I think they use the bloated UI to conceal that there's not a lot of useful content. Worth trying, but don't go for yearly payments!",3,2023-11-24 22:30:56

A Google user,"The app is ok. The problem is when you want to cancel the app and reach a live person. It is nearly impossible. Don't expect a response from their online forms...it's just silence.

A Google user,"My mom rants and raves about the calm app. I got it though a tmobile promo at a super good discounted rate so I figured why not give it a try. Honestly some things are okay but not great by any means. Some of the sleep stories are relaxing but some are weird, some of the voices they use for sleep stories or meditations are NOT RELAXING AT ALL! Some of the meditations are also too short.

To get the full list of feelings, I need to go to Discovery, Tools where I need my clicks to access or find. Entering my reflections multiple times in a day creates separate memos, each one numbered with 1. Why not concatenate everything for the day into one post and number then 1. 2. 3. Etc?

I already pay good money for both of these services that do basically the same thing but better. I did find myself enjoying the short stories on here, but the content is very, very limited, which is this app's major downfall.

A Google user,Great marketing campaign to download this app. Shows you just how useful it is! But hang on....When I have actually downloaded the app over 90% of the content is locked and you have to pay for it. What is there to actually use is paltry. So thanks for sweet fa! UN-downloaded! ..... UPDATE..... Calm responded to me saying there's a free version & to email them. So i did... The reply was a long winded way of saying well actually we don't offer a free version other than the 7 day trial. Umm thanks!,1,2023-09-11 15:37:22

Yes, this is exactly what every woman wants to hear, a man mouth breathing in their living room (or wherever she is listening.) I dont think this ad could be anymore offensive and sexually abusive. Calm marketing people need to seriouly consider their audience and be more sensitive. Because as they stand, they clearly don't care. Calm = sexual harrasment.",1,2023-09-10 00:07:38

And nap meditations / stories where you can customize the time eg 15m to 1h. Would also appreciate a UI that is less overstimulating and simpler to navigate.

A Google user,"i dont really get it.. like you just put it on to play rain sounds? why would someone pay for this?? Ok i gave it like 4 more minutes before immediately cancelling it. All the sounds and ""meditation"" stuff is free and better on youtube and there doesnt seem to be any way to talk to person now that this comoany has my credit card info (it was a 4 month free trial). I took a screensjot of the cancellation bc some other jabroni couldnt get their money back.",1,2023-05-31 00:30:18
A Google user,"I just want an app with a guided meditation and you guys don't have it. I LOVE this app but omg. You have either timed mediation where nobody says ANYTHING. Or a 10 minute video where i dont know WHAT crazy stuff that guys about to say. All that I PERSONALLY want is a 10-20-30-60 minute ""guided mediation"" option. Where the person says ""come back to your breathe"" only once every say 2,3 or 4 minutes. I don't need to hear a lecture every time i meditate. I just wanna get in and get out haha.",3,2023-05-30 15:30:06
A Google user,"They will not, repeat not, let you cancel your subscription. I have tried for hours to cancel and still can't get it done. The app is no different than any other app of the same description. You can't cancel, is the only problem. I'm trying to block them from my bank account - it's the only thing left I can think of that I haven't tried. In short, nothing to crow about here. Plenty to avoid. Don't download this app. You'll be sorry if you do.",1,2023-05-30 10:53:18

A Google user,"Notifications galore and slow. I love the soundscapes, and the other content but as someone who downloaded this app to reduce stress I found that there were notifications every other hour telling me to 'relax' and also it's so slow!

A Google user,Worst app ever. Limited content. Constantly crashes. Beyond slow. Like 1980's dial up slow. Not very calming. Never responds. If you set a timer for the app to stop playing a track it wont stop and will contiune to play all night long. But if u want to play a 15 min track it will take 30 mins to get it to play & it will crash 10 times. Got it for free through school & I won't even keep it for free. Pure garbage.

A Google user,"The app freezes often, is buggy and has long load times. Poor usability in terms of finding what you need. I wish it had more of a classic catalogue feel, as opposed to an app that is trying to force feed you new content like a trendy media streaming platform. It feels like one in many other ways.

A Google user,Make this free with ads! I thought it would be really nice to have my alarm clock wake me with soothing music until I found out the price was ridiculously high. A feature like this that cost $70 SHOULD include a private masseuse coming to your house! Now after reading reviews I feel bad for folks that got ripped off.

A Google user,"Used to love this app but it's become way too expensive. I get the sense they're running a capitalistic growth model at odds with the ethos at the heart of the original app. It's become stuffed with celebrity readings and unnecessary extras that you end up paying for when all you really need is the core meditation, breathing and soundscape elements. I thought I'd have this app forever because it was once life-changing, but it's unaffordable now.",2,2023-05-03 11:11:00

A Google user,Honestly what got this rating is the user experience to cancel their subscription. In app doesn't work nore the website. I had to manually direct myself to manage my play services because the directions on the app didn't have the desired redirect. App seemed useful when I did use it haven't given it a go to build a habit in a 7 day trial or my only other option it seamed was sign up for the whole year.,1,2023-04-30 13:15:19

A Google user,The app is fine but it's not for me. My issue is how ridiculous they make it to try to cancel the subscription. IT SHOULD NOT BE A SCAVENGER HUNT. You should be able to cancel from your phone or the website. It should not take someone 30 mins to try to figure this out.

The meditation course itself was great and I recommend it to everyone. Moreover often the images of the tracks and playlists don't show up. I really miss the option to create a custom playlist. I would like to use chosen tracks for background music. Overall the app is pretty buggy but does its work.,3,2023-03-21 08:33:48

It's also an issue in instances where there is no service or Wi-Fi such as camping and hiking. In AZ there are a lot of dead zones.

Lewis Straight,"I'm a big fan of the people who narrate the meditation sessions with personal anecdotes, stories and such. What I dislike though is the home page and the layout of the app, the home screen should feel like HOME but you can't customize anything there. Ideally it would also be better to have all meditation session 'courses' on 1 page. There's a lot of content I'm not listening to simply because it's not organised to my liking enough to break the barrier of effort/reward to find it.",3,2023-02-09 06:39:03

CHRIS DUCHSCHER,Well first of all the free aspect.(Garbage). People trying to overcome anxiety stress and panic. Will remain while knowing that you need to pay 70 some dollars which is a small fortune for some people to get the premium aspect. I just can't. knowing that without paying the whole amount you really will still have all the issues remain creating anxiety itself. I can't do it. Make a better free trial or actually let people who need it use it. Not what was expected.,1,2023-02-07 02:16:07

Found out too late, that I had to cancel the subscription with Googleplay also. I don't know how I was supposed to know that. In the meantime, the one year subscription was taken out of my bank account. I really couldn't afford it, especially since it didn't help.

R Lew,Tv commercial said now free. Not from what I'm seeing. $69 for the year and when you back out they try and offer a discount at $49 a year. I'm sorry but this is way too expensive especially on top of all my other subscriptions like music and TV. No such thing as a bad product but price is definitely a issue. Yeah they offer a 7 day free trial but we all know the nightmare behind auto payment that comes along with these free trials. I really think you should honor the tv advertisement.,1,2023-02-05 08:47:07
Cecile Ferreboeuf Clayes,"I have the paid version and will not renew. Pros : beautiful interfaces and contents (images, sounds...etc) Cons: 1-application is way too noisy (even when deactivating notifications). Too much stuff, no hierarchy, it keeps throwing new stuff in your face for you to 'consume', where really, the goal is the opposite. 2-navigating the app is a nightmare.

My internet connection is fine, it's frustrating when you're already trying to fall asleep, and you have to restart an app that is supposed to ""calm"" you.",1,2023-01-23 12:26:31
Lonnisha Lyons,Too Expensive. Deleted the app.,1,2023-01-23 10:09:42
Josiah Herrera,"I saw this app late at night and thought it would be helpful for some sleep. So I downloaded it and I looked into it and you literally have to pay for almost everything. I understand they are trying to make a profit but like geez, that doesn't mean you make everything come with the premium version. I can't even fall asleep without having to pay monthly subscription for some measly sleep stories. Do better and don't make people pay for their mental health to get better.",1,2023-01-23 08:48:12
Steve Jones,"Great concept, poor execution. I saw an ad for dark noise to help you sleep and relax, can't find it in the app. The default home screen noise turns off when I turn off my phone screen instead of running in the background so to sleep with this sound I have to keep my phone screen on?",2,2023-01-23 08:31:25
Addie Mahoney,I would do the free trial and probably prescribe but they don't offer monthly payments or an easy unsubscribe. Why can't it be monthly? Must not be that great if you need a year subscription and all the money up front.,1,2023-01-23 07:58:33
MUSIC GOD,premium isn't a suggestion it's more forced on you,2,2023-01-23 06:57:22

Katie Zunino,"I've seen a lot of stupid in app purchases, but to lock the entirety of an apps content behind a YEARLY subscription has got to be the stupidest.",1,2023-01-23 04:09:31
martin kimball,If it's free when advertised why do I have to pay for it.,1,2023-01-23 03:23:20
