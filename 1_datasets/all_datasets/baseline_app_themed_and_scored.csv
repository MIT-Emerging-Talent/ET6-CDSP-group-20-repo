A Google user,update.... please developers fix this problem or i want my premium subscription refunded!!! it worked fine but now the session closes after 1 pm or 2 minutes. useless!!! tried clearing cache etc such a shame as the sessions from tamara are great. this is since recent update the meditations shut down after a few minutes and then continue to do so if you restart and go to where it closed. shame as it doesn't lend itself to a calm few minutes. hopefully.this can be fixed soon.
