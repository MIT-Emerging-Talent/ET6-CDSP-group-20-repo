BadlandsAllicat,i'm so disappointed i now have to pay for this app. i wanted to have a good moment and look at how far i've come by looking through my years of tracking and now it is all gone because i can't afford to pay.,1,2022-02-04 05:50:48,-1,Specific/Niche Complaint,Outliers / Generic,-1
Siân M,used the app when it first came out and deleted it when i found i didn't need it anymore. meaning it worked brilliantly!! downloaded it again today and wowza has it changed for the worse. bit uncomfortable giving my phone number to recieve a plan i don't even want. the old version didn't require that. all i hoped was to be able to use the app to rationalise my thoughts and track my mood. very disappointed :((( will have to find a replacement now,1,2022-02-03 03:52:15,3,Mental Health & Therapy Framing,Feature-Specific Issues,-1
Jamie Jacopelle,"same as everyone else, disappointed by changes. i hadn't used the app in a year, almost exactly a year. every january and february my depression gets bad, and i wanted to track my moods again like i had been for a few years. now you can't do anything except subscribe to talk to a therapist and everything is paid. i have a therapist already, i was just trying to continue mood tracking. i'm so disappointed. now i have to find a new app to use.",1,2022-02-02 19:41:26,9,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,-1
Allison Stickel,"i used to use this app all the time. the ai ""i'm feeling..."" chat was a great way for me to journal how i felt and take the next appropriate steps to feel better. however now it is a money-grabbing paywall. they obviously don't care about helping people anymore, they just want profit. which, i would be willing to pay up to $10 one time just to have that ai chat feature again. but it looks like they would rather be like every other therapy subscription that preys on the depressed and anxious.",1,2022-02-02 14:07:13,-1,Specific/Niche Complaint,Outliers / Generic,0
A W,"i am also a member of ""i used to love this app, but now..."" i can't even login now without having to answer a thousand personal questions that apparently will be used to help you find a counselor/therapist for a weekly fee. i don't need a counselor or therapist, i need an app to help me in between my appointments with my already-established healthcare team. huge disappointment to have seen this app shifted in the way that it has. it was really helpful the way that it was. boo.",1,2022-01-27 06:28:56,9,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,-1

J Batts,"changed from a 5 to 1 star review. i loved this app so much for so long. i had the app to track my mental health and take with the ai all of the last 5 years and really needed it today. i loved this app so much before. could have just as easy made a separate app for the paid therapy and kept this one for the free tracker on its own, right? maybe a cheap subscription for the ai and tracker for a few bucks.",1,2022-01-24 11:58:01,9,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,1
Fearie Star,"changed my review from 4 stars to 2. i just opened the app after a year to look through my past chats with the ai and saw that every single thing was paywalled! i wasn't expecting that! i wish youper would have communicated this change to users, because that's really important after using the app for free for 3 years. i understand that they need to make money, but i wish there were more supscription options. especially for people who don't want a therapist and just want the ai.",2,2022-01-22 15:42:35,9,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,-1

Prokriti Basu,disappointed that they have gotten rid of the ai. the previous version of youper was incredibly useful to me and i could have used that form of it again now. disappointed that just communicating with the ai is no longer an option. devastating.,1,2022-01-16 09:04:45,-1,Specific/Niche Complaint,Outliers / Generic,-1

Ash White,i'm so upset. i went to get access to this app again and get back on track and now i can't use the main functions without a subscription? you guys are the absolute worst for taking advantage of people with mental illnesses. no one wants your generic apology sitting on a paywall.,1,2022-01-11 10:49:39,9,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,-1
Rebecca Stoebe,"like others i used this app for a long time and loved it. now everything is subscription based. if they had even 1/10 of the features that used to be free still available for free (symptom tracking, ai conversation/diary, mood tracking, meditation, etc) this would be a 5/5 app. but everything is behind a paywall, which sucks. i already have some of the things offered here (ie a therapist), so to pay for everything in a bundle as the only option is a bummer.",1,2022-01-10 04:05:28,-1,Specific/Niche Complaint,Outliers / Generic,1
Jackson Kulinski,i used to use this app to map my mood and track triggers and it genuinely helped. the app now has no free options and has moved completely behind a paywall. it is devastating and was done with no warning. the $36 a month is too high to ask for an ai service. i am fairly certain no one asked for this.,1,2022-01-09 06:49:45,9,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,-1
Elena Cazacu,"this app had helped me tremendously just for the simple feature where i could write down my feelings. a feature now costing $85. seeing that i can't use any of the features anymore was very disheartening and has affected my mental health in a very bad way. i guess the ones that are not privileged don't deserve help. not a single human response to new comments. only bots. maybe you don't care about people's well-being as much as you advertise it, sadly. all we ever wanted was discreet help.",1,2022-01-08 14:53:34,9,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,-1
