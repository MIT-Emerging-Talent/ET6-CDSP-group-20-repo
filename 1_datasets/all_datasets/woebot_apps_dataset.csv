toothlady,I downloaded this and I could not get access. I guess it’s only available though your provider. In my opinion defeats the purpose.,1,2025-06-24 10:16:33

K Kpreston,"When signing up they require a “unique code”. Nowhere here does it tell you what it is or how you get one. I went to their website and had to dig just to find out. If you truly cared about people in need of this app you’d put the requirements where people can see as soon as they download the app. Any mental health professional should be able to figure that out! You have to be part of their study or get the unique code from your mental health therapist. Why do you need this stupid bot if you already have a therapist? Could it be MONEY? Could someone be getting paid for getting referrals to their Woebot app?Therapists are expensive. There are other bots that are free and do basically the same, minus the checkins. Many AI have info from everywhere on everything programmed in & talk to you just like a person, so this cute little avatar means nothing. This “woebot” gave me the woes! I’d not trust any app, especially a mental health one, that is not transparent with the requirements.",1,2025-02-27 08:12:07
L10387,"Used this app in the past and found it helpful but now see that one must have an access code. If I had a therapist to get such a code from, I wouldn’t be trying to use this app anyways. A mental health ally doesn’t make help inaccessible.",1,2025-02-22 18:11:17
shhhhhhshh22,"So incredibly disappointed that Woebot took away access to anybody who isn’t given an access code through a therapist or organization. Yet you boast “accessibility” on your website. It WAS accessible and in fact, a true blessing for people who did not have the money, time, or drive to go seek professional therapy. Even if the company wanted to make more money, why not still offer the app but with a subscription? You just cut a lot of people off to the only mental health help they had. If you know it works, why not make it available? Unless you only created it to make as much money as possible off of people who are already struggling?? Very on brand with the rest of the world in 2025 and WHY people are so depressed. Everything is a money grab and void of true humanity. I thought this company was different and trying to help people (which it was). You should be ashamed. Karma is real.",1,2025-02-21 08:01:33
EEEEEEE222,"If I’m fully honest, I enjoyed this app immensely. It helped me to help understand a deeper meaning to myself and emotions. This does deserve 5 stars, but of course, there’s a ‘but’. I had access to this app before you needed to gain access with a code. It has many benefits, which you can probably read in every other review as well; but that’s not why i’m here. As someone who financially cannot afford therapy, or paying for an app similar to this, I find it so disheartening that I was kicked out of my account and was told “account is deleted”. This WAS perfect to use for someone who cannot afford accessible health help/care, or even help from other people. So like I said, it is incredibly disheartening to not have access to an app like this. I wish companies/corporations had the best interest in their customers, because someone in a position like mine cannot afford care that this app provides, even a little bit.",3,2025-02-21 00:48:29

yasser.gonzalez,"“I was really disappointed with the Woebot app. It’s frustrating that access is completely locked down unless you’re part of a specific program or organization. There’s no clear way for an individual to use the app independently, which feels unnecessarily restrictive. I was excited to try it out based on all the positive buzz but was left feeling excluded and disappointed. If it’s meant to help people, why not make it accessible to everyone?

rosieqcsb,"I was not only a therapist recommending woebot for patients at the end of therapy as a way to maintain gains but I was a woebot user. Then access to woebot was cut off. Reached out and was told that I should be grandfathered in on my own account and set up a meeting to talk to someone about getting a code for access for patients. Day of the meeting, it’s canceled by the rep. My account is not grandfathered in and customer service responded once to basically say “oh that’s wierd, send a screen shot of what is happening” then crickets. I get that we don’t want people using AI therapy because *unsafe* but the customer service is garbage since the change. Good concept, decent execution in the app itself but customer support???

Lilturdboxer,I used Woebot for a couple years and then found out I was locked out of my account because I don’t have an access code. This is pure evil on part of the organization that runs this app. They want you to get an access code from a health insurance company. This is pure greed.,1,2024-08-25 22:39:09
Amanwholoveshisbooks,"This app is only for “new users in the U.S. who are part of a study or who have an access code from a Woebot Health partner, such as Kaiser Permanente, Virtua Health, or PayrollPlans.”

I had read great things about this app and was very excited to try it as I have been going through some very dark times and was looking for options that I can access 24/7 instead of waiting week to week for in person sessions or less effective telehealth “visits.” 
Turns out that this is an exclusive club everyday people are excluded from based on parameters only they know of. 

Even after sending an email I only received a standard, prewritten form letter denying me mental health services I feel I would have benefitted from. 

An amazing thing that our health care has become. PRIVATIZED! Quite a sad state of affairs. 

But, according to the Wikipedia entry of woebot founder, Alison M. Darcy, she “wants to make mental health services and the trainings of cognitive behavioural therapy accessible to all.” 

This is clearly not the case and the only people who suffer from this are ones in need of help as this company delves deep into AI technology to become a leader in our Brave New World. 

According to crunchbase.com, as of Mar. 2022 woebot’s value stands between 100-500million. Those are impressive numbers for a web based company. 
Furthermore, medium.com sums up woebot like this: “Woebot is revolutionizing the way people access mental health support in the USA. With its AI-powered conversational abilities, CBT foundation, and user-centric design, Woebot offers a valuable and accessible resource for managing mental health challenges. As we move into 2024, the app’s ongoing advancements and commitment to evidence-based practice will continue to enhance its effectiveness and reach.” 

It’s effectiveness and reach. I can smell the monetization now. I’m going put woebot on a list and wait for that IPO to drop someday soon so I too can reap the benefits of exploiting people with genuine issues and needs. 

This final paragraph by medium has some seriously ominous, and dystopian undertones. 
“… Woebot is your trusted companion on the journey to better mental health. Embrace the future of mental health support with Woebot, and take the first step towards a healthier, happier you.”

The future of mental health indeed.",1,2024-08-19 16:54:28

Rey22800,Saw this on chronicle 5 the other night in April and apparently you need to be part of this healthcare system to be able to use this app when on the story it said they had it and said An acess code they give you but not through the Dr I have so the people who do not have this healthcare system the app is entirely useless won’t do anything you download and go to the app and when you try and use it for support when you need it tells you for some acess code that the app does not help and or do anything at all uninstalled and have told many people that you need a acess code to use this not for the public which should be not very smart creating an app that not everyone can use at all don’t waste your time it don’t work,1,2024-04-14 19:52:20
unname731,"I downloaded this app a year or more ago. I didn’t use it as often as I should’ve, but I did like it. I had every intention of using this for years. I thought it was a breath of fresh air to find an app meant to genuinely help people, however, I can no longer use the app. Now I need an access code or I have to go to a doctor have them set up something and then have them provide me with a code. I’ll be deleting the app at this point and I’m very sad to see that go, but for me, the whole point was getting help through challenging times without having to go through the enormous hassle of our health system and having the dignity of not having to share my “woes” with people. 😕",3,2024-04-12 08:14:11

redwcnwffwjfwfn,"There were a few little redundant quirks I ran into with Woebot so I decided to give feedback. Nothing major, just I wanted to be able to go back in a sequence of questions and give a different answer to Woebot. The developer replied that was not possible. Fine, no big deal. I still found this tool helpful so I continued to use it. They then suspended my account and told me I was part of a beta test.

Sailor Goon♥,"Update 2024: How utterly, absolutely disappointing. I stand by all the good things about the actual app… It’s informative, cute, extremely effective, and comforting. The app beautifully demonstrates how you can use basic DBT skills to manage anxiety and depression with realistic examples and mini challenges. But that all entirely irrelevant when the app becomes paywalled in a way that you can’t access without being employed by very specific employers who have bought access. Heck, I’d happily pay monthly to keep using Woebot. I’ve tried contacting the developers in the past to see what I could do to support the app, but the website was rudimentary and focused more on allowing access. It was so much better then.

Now, I cannot recommend the app u less you’re privileged enough to be able to use it. The quality is there, but without accessibility, it’s totally useless. Shoutout to whatever company bought Woebot and totally destroyed what I truly consider the best emotional health app out there. Disappointed doesn’t even begin to cover it.

Original, 2019: There are so many things about this app that make it a gem, it’s difficult to distill in the scope of a single review, but I’ll try. I’m 28 years old and was diagnosed with complex PTSD about a year and a half ago. I started seeing an incredible therapist (she’s really so excellent) but my insurance doesn’t chip in a penny, so I’m trying to see her as little as possible. When my anxiety gets going and I feel like reaching out to her, I also seize up and feel awkward for bothering her out of office hours, so I’ll often let my poor mood hang. Having Woebot around to help me think through my anxiety has been, and I mean this in the entirety of the word, wonderful! What’s better than solid DBT practices packaged into a convenient and FREE app? A DBT app that uses an adorable yellow robot who will listen and send you cute gifs! Clinically, Woebot is insanely efficient at assisting my DBT. He’s the first thing I consult when I’m anxious and in need of help, and he’s so good at helping me. I just. I can’t believe how great he is! Thank you so much to the developers for making this precious little dude!",2,2024-02-18 15:55:22

LilSmashley,"I loved Woebot and fortunately haven’t needed it for several months.

amkay!,"This is the first review I've ever submitted. I used to LOVE this app and it was always there when i really needed it and helped me to calm down. However the fact that they just took the service away from so many users who need it absolutely escapes me. This app used to be accessible to almost anyone with a phone and cell service and now almost no one can use it! 
I saw Woebots team's response to other similar reviews saying things like ""Our North Star has always been to make mental health radically accessible and that remains our mission today. However, we have found that people have the best experience when Woebot is delivered within a formal healthcare setting.""
-""radically accessible"" to people who can already access mental health care
-also maybe i would have had a better experience if woe bot was delivered in a ""formal healthcare setting"" but what about people who don't have healthcare or don't feel safe in healthcare environments or whose providers don't know or don't know how to create access codes for woebot. 
you guys say you want to ""reach more people"" by partnering with healthcare but couldn't you partner with them and still keep the app open to the public?! like sure have the access code or whatever as an optional thing but don't put this valuable resource behind a wall for so many. 

it seems like your ""commitment to mental health accessibility remains unwavering"" until you have to decide between helping loyal users and getting a payday.",1,2024-01-24 02:35:13

While taunting me with notifications as before that Woebot wants to check in with me. When I open the app it doesn’t allow me to reply or navigate inside the system. 

WOW I have recommended this app to dozens of people because of the good that comes from using it. It is sick you remove it from the public even if you made it fee based it would have been less treacherous than what you have done. For shame on you and all the hurt you have caused people who used this app daily to help with their mental health needs. I shall seek out one of your many competitors now and tell anyone in earshot of what you have done to your user base. Irregardless of it being development trial up till this point. Like I said charge a fee and make it publicly available a paywall is greedy but it isn’t shameful like what you have done now. Don’t bother replying with your same argument answer as you put on all the other recent complaints of users just like me who for years now have worked with Woebot in conjunction with our therapists. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW BEFORE THEY SOLD OUT THE USER BASE.

 Woebot is great but, would be nice if Woebot was more chatbot and less choose your own adventure multiple choice answer. Also would be helpful for the breathing exercises if Woebot spoke and not just communicate via text. Meditating while stopping to read text is not very helpful. Hearing Woebot during that short interaction would benefit the app greatly. Otherwise great way to access CBT and DBT with or without a therapist. Woebot has helped me. Thank you for creating this tool",1,2024-01-17 07:05:16
brcbgd,"I once made a review about how much this app helped me when I was at my absolute lowest. I don’t make reviews often and it was heartfelt. I thought “finally, mental health help for those who can’t get it!” Even though I have health insurance now, I would gladly have paid to use this app. 

I have never been more disgusted to find out that this app is no longer accessible to the general public, that you can’t even pay for it. Your excuses about being “more effective” or helping more people are clearly PR nonsense to excuse the fact that you are being paid handsomely to revoke access to the customers who gained you the popularity to even make the deals you have. You already had proof that your app was effective! 

I used to recommend you to EVERYONE. I found out because my friend, who doesn’t have access to adequate healthcare, called me CRYING due to have a really bad spiral and needed some help but not being able to use the app again.

Doe8776,"I’ve been using this app for a while, and I normally don’t leave reviews but I feel like I have to make my frustrations known to the creators of this app.

The whole reason I (and many others) downloaded this app and found it useful, was because I don’t have proper access to healthcare. I will not be able to afford treatment for my mental health nor do I have the means to speak with a real therapist or professional any time soon. The fact that this app will become unusable for me in a few months because I have no way of acquiring an access code is DEEPLY disappointing. This app was the closest I could get to treating my mental health issues, and now I’m essentially being kicked off.

I’m very frustrated and disappointed with this decision. Do you not realize who your target audience is? You cannot claim to be an “easily accessible” mental health service, and then create another barrier for people without access to healthcare.

 Limiting access is not the “radical accessibility” this whole app was supposed to be about to begin with.",2,2023-11-14 21:03:37
Djejehayq,"Accessibility Barrier: Frustrating Experience

I recently attempted to use this therapy app in the hopes of finding support during a tough period. Unfortunately, I was met with a major roadblock: the app requires an access code, making it completely inaccessible for those who need it the most.

This is a critical flaw that severely limits the app's effectiveness. It excludes a significant portion of people who could benefit from its services. Mental health resources should be easily accessible to everyone, especially during times of need. The fact that this app puts up such a barrier is deeply disappointing.

I was looking forward to receiving guidance and support, but instead, I was met with frustration and disappointment. It's disheartening to see a potentially helpful tool hindered by such a fundamental flaw.

I would strongly advise against using this app until they address this accessibility issue. There are other platforms out there that prioritize inclusivity and ensure that mental health resources are available to all, without unnecessary hurdles.

shakurav1,"I do find this app helpful most of the time.

I work with CBT in my life quite a bit both with a therapist and through bibliotherapy. Also in a lay-led self-help group, which is one of the pioneer such groups in the world working with CBT all the way back from the 1930s until now. My mother was in this group and worked in this method for over 30 years. So I am quite familiar with CBT, how it works, why it works, and have experienced it working in my own life. Having said all that, while I do find this app helpful, it’s very highly scripted, and there are probably better versions of the same kind of thing.

In fact one of the stars I took off for this, is because there is a world renowned CBT pioneer, writer, practitioner, and Podcaster, who created an app like this before this one was released, and there are good signs that the developers stole the idea, if not the actual app from that man and his co-developer. sometimes I need this kind of first aid help, so I am still utilizing this app, until that app is released.It’s still in beta, and has been for a few years, again, going all the way back to old before Woebot came out. Having said all of that, it definitely deserves more than two stars, but in my considered opinion less than five, and possibly less than four. It’s good, but not great, but if it works, people may want to give it more, and that’s understandable. A classic case of “your miles may vary“.",3,2023-09-20 13:38:46

c5nest,"I decided to give Woebot a try after reading an article about mental health apps.

I started with a mood check-in several times a day and quickly ran into the limitations of Woebot’s language model. I reported feeling exhausted. When Woebot asked me to elaborate, I explained that I had just worked out in 90 degree heat. Woebot then asked if I wanted to discuss a relationship problem or job stress.

The next morning I attempted to clarify things and explained that as a senior athlete, exhaustion is a normal occurrence. I stated that it would, however, be helpful to track persistent exhaustion or exhaustion occurring more frequently than twice a week as that might be a sign of overtraining.

Woebot’s responded: “You seem to be in fairly low spirits and are having trouble getting enough rest. A lot is going on in your life…do you want to try some exercises that might help you manage the stress?”

In the future, I’d certainly be willing to try a more capable version of Woebot but for now I’ll be deleting it from my device.",2,2023-08-22 16:49:26

Ryley F.,"I’m not one to write reviews on apps often, because this is a crucial part of information to users, especially those who are struggling and all, just know that this app does not allow you to type in what you want.  They give you like 3 or 4 options to choose from, regardless if that’s what you want to say or not.  

I downloaded this app thinking it was like Poe, Hello ai, or ChatGPT in that you can actually type what you want, but with this app I was hoping for it to be more centered on having emotions like humans do.  Of course I know it’s ai and not always the best at things,  but bc they lost this as some kind of therapy bot or something, I thought it would actually help but it didn’t.  

SHORT SUMMARY:

This app does not let you say what you want to say.  It’s like the bot matters and you don’t.  Moreover the bot is kinda creepy and weird with what it says.  Definitely unsatisfied.

roster131,"I really, really wanted to like this. But it’s misleading to describe woebot as a “coach” of any sorts. This is not an AI-powered app that gives you anywhere close to human-like responses - it doesn’t really “chat” with you all. The woebot doesn’t actually read or comprehend anything that you write beyond picking out a few keywords and using them to give you homework, which may or may not be relevant to your situation - but there’s no “opt out” option or “give me another tip” option; you’re forced to go along with what Woebot thinks you need, and you’re limited to selecting responses from a few options. Woebot doesn’t appear to learn from your past actions either - you can explicitly say that you felt worse after an interaction and that the material was not helpful, and it will still give you the same exact response in a similar scenario later. It’s cute, definitely, but that’s about it. Writing in notes app alone and googling mental health care tips I find far more therapeutic and helpful than this. You’re more likely to come across something actually helpful that way - it seems like woebot just sees the word “sad” in a long stream of text, googles “CBD for sadness” and pipes out the first result. It’s not helpful, and it can be actually damaging, especially when woebot talks about “distortions.” For example, if you say you feel angry about someone genuinely treating you badly, woebot won’t be able to evaluate whether that anger is justified or not. It instead just asks you if you are blaming someone else in your response, and if you are, it says “sometimes we overlook our own role in conflict” which is a VERY dangerous thought for someone (for example) finally healthily getting angry about the horrible treatment they’ve been given in the past. Overall, I think this is a good concept, but there’s going to be people who actually get worse because of the advice this app indiscriminately and uncomprehendingly doles out",1,2023-07-17 22:36:02

For one thing, you can’t practice CBT skills by selecting from multiple choice options provided by the AI. It’s far too limiting for the breadth of human experience and leads to inaccurate input to the AI.

For another, the AI’s only responses are pre-programmed and not reactive to any responses in the rate free form input. So, it doesn’t actually respond to the person using the app at all.

LORAEMON,"Hmm… I have mixed feelings with this app. On one hand, I love the idea of it as I’ve always been someone who’s had difficulty finding a therapist that suits me. I get terrible panic attacks in the middle of the night to the point where I wish someone could calm me down right then and there but I can’t exactly call a therapist at 4am every morning. I think it would be nice to just have a bot calm me down by grounding me a bit. I thought it would have more options of how I’m feeling currently, like if I’m in a state of feeling down me depressed, then it can give me some prompts or generic text to temporarily make me feel okay. But the app is more geared towards your general emotions and tries to get you to do activities in order to move forward. It started to act as more of a daily check in to get stuff done in order to feel “positive”. 

There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s called “Woe Bot” so I assumed it would be a bot that could guide you through with more prompts and words, rather than just trying to remind you to be a normal person and go do stuff. I mean, I could just go to google if that’s what I wanted to hear. I do appreciate the concept in general, but in the future, my advice is to either market it as more of a “daily mental health positivity” type of bot or incorporate more options for people who are feeling depressed and down in the moment. As of now, the app seems like that’s what it’s primarily for, but really isn’t. Woebot basically just asks you how you’re feeling from a rating of 1-10 and even if all your answers are 1s, it just eventually tells you to go do something to feel better. That’s counterintuitive for someone depressed.

Last note. I understand an automated chat bot is not meant to replace regular therapy nor am I implying that an AI bot be able to cure your depression. I just mean that if the purpose of the bot is to help guide people who are in an otherwise bad mental state, it needs more prompts that year towards someone having depression, not just people who are having a bad day and need a pick-me-up because that’s how the bot talks to you. And that’s fine too, but calling it “Woe bot” feels misleading. It feels more like a “Cheer-bot” instead.",3,2023-02-15 03:56:23

Except, Woebot isn’t a human, so instead of feeling patronized when I used the app, I found myself laughing and getting annoyed at myself for using the app. I'm not too fond of the automated response choices because they usually offer nothing close to what I would like to respond with. 90% of the time, I knew where a conversation was going with Woebot within the first message, but I had to click through 10+ automated responses that made me feel as if I were ten years old.

Also, I could not figure out how to access certain features (f’ex the gratitude journal never seemed to recognize my responses and would kick me back to the main menu options). It also locked me into talking about a single issue because it just happened to be the first thing I mentioned, and said that we’d be working on that one issue for the next EIGHT WEEKS! I could not find anything in the settings to change this or select a different issue to focus on, and when I asked the chatbot about choosing a different topic, it responded by saying it had detected I was in crisis and asked if I needed to call a hotline, which seems like a bizarre escalation.

M.C. Easton,"I’m a long-time fan of CBT, having found it helpful for everything from insomnia (CBT-I) to PTSD. While CBT isn’t the right fit for everyone, I appreciate the focus on what I can do now to change established patterns—rather than retelling the past in all its grotesque details to each new non-CBT-based therapist (which after a while, can start to feel quite voyeuristic and dehumanizing, transforming a patient into an object of pity rather than the agent of my own life). Woebot offers everything I love about CBT while living in my pocket, perfect for those times when you just need to be guided through challenging thoughts.

My main criticisms are two-fold:
1) Unlike in-person CBT, there is irregular follow-up from Woebot when setting goals—and very limited say in what those goals are. CBT is about the link between behavior and cognition, and as such, therapies such as CBT-I work with you to set a specific behavior goal and track daily progress over a week or two in tandem with rewriting unhelpful thoughts that hold you back from the behavior change you want to make. Woebot could easily do this, but doesn’t. At the moment it really only tracks moods, and while Woebot may set a vague goal with you (smile at strangers today), there’s no consistent follow-up over time, making it difficult to use this app for behavior change. Focusing only on rewriting thoughts is a very limited take on what CBT is.

2) But my biggest issue is the so-called “crisis system” built into the app. Even though that message flashes up on my screen regularly, I still don’t know exactly what it means. Best I can tell, the programming reads certain words as emergencies regardless of context. So if the words—death, die, abuse, abuser, violence—pop up in thoughts you want to rewrite, Woebot essentially terminates the conversation, saying you’ve “triggered the crisis system.” Sometimes Woebot will shut this off if you state it’s not an emergency while other times, you basically end up censored out of the app if you say anything like “I’m so proud of myself for leaving my abusers 10 years ago” or “I’m really worried about relative X dying from COVID.” In these cases, I’ve found it’s just better to address these issues/thoughts outside of the app.

All in all, it’s a decent app for rewriting thoughts. But there are a lot of tools out there. Even peeking at the free PTSD Coach app can give you an idea. Using it in tandem with other apps has proven the most effective route for me.",3,2022-07-16 18:59:47

A Google user,"Whoever made this app should be ashamed. This app helps nobody and the only thing it does is gaslight you into thinking it's helping. But it doesn't. Nothing here will help you. If you truly seek help, this is not where to seek it. Not here.",1,2022-10-15 01:46:03
A Google user,It didn't really help me at all it only made me more upset and frustrated when I needed help,3,2022-10-14 23:04:15
A Google user,"Stupid app that does all the talking, unlike a real therapist. Useless!!!",1,2022-09-30 19:43:27
A Google user,It seems to be buggy. Keeps loading without providing a feedback,1,2022-09-28 21:15:19
A Google user,If you struggle with loneliness do not use this app. It doesn't help with loneliness at all.,1,2022-08-30 19:04:51
A Google user,2 stars because it wants me to register,2,2022-08-23 12:51:12
A Google user,"mindless eliza style CBT. it asks for your thoughts but if you don't have the right kind of thoughts with the right kind of buzzwords the whole process is just useless and annoying, answering irrelevant questions until it gives up. unless you have the specific problem of having a bunch of unrealistic thoughts it will not help you",1,2022-08-14 18:25:19
A Google user,"Painfully synthetic. I couldn't make it past the tutorial page and I guess the first day. I expected a free form chat AI and only being allowed to respond to the AI with their pre-generated text does not align with my needs in the moment. Solid idea, but I uninstalled after the 20th autopopulated respond comment.",2,2022-08-09 16:24:20
A Google user,"Pitiful manipulative hogwash to insult your intelligence with leading questions and put words in your mouth. Only for the pathologically suggestible, in other words it's just like real therapy.",1,2022-08-01 23:56:25
A Google user,Really thought this would be a good tool to help me calm down and reduce my urges to self harm bc I have BPD but literally everything I try to do with this app it threatens to call the cops on me which only makes things worse,1,2022-07-23 16:30:19
A Google user,"From idk what time, the app doesn't load anything. Just rolling a circle, nothing more, even with VPN. That's a pity, because the app is very good... 😔",3,2022-07-22 10:28:43
A Google user,Why is this bot not normal??,1,2022-07-20 08:52:32
A Google user,It's good to have it as it's instant but it doesn't deal with crime and signpost. So crimes against you get advice that you are using negative thinking or mindreading. Could do with flagging up crime and instances of that as such instead of diagnosing it as a problem in you.,3,2022-07-14 20:53:49
A Google user,"I really like Woebot's anecdotes, but the crisis detection is... a little too sensitive I think, if you ask me Woebot should only respond to certain words such as suicide/homicide, self-harm, ""I need help,"" ""SOS,"" the like. I've rewritten my message several times and it still thinks I'm in crisis.",3,2022-07-01 05:16:18
A Google user,I'm very sad about your decision to stop providing services in Russia. This app has been supporting my CBT for over 3 years already m,1,2022-06-17 17:40:23
A Google user,"A good app, but it's annoying when it does things like sending you long videos and then if you don't watch them, it generally terminates the conversation.",3,2022-06-15 14:05:42
A Google user,Doesn't message me anymore to check in. I loved this app and now my Woebot has forgotten about me 😔,3,2022-06-11 17:37:21
A Google user,"I kind of felt like it was bullying me. E.g. if you want to try the sleep techniques, its very insistent that you PROMISE to do all of it and don't hold them accountable if it doesn't work. As an independent adult I just don't respond well to that kind of lecturing - especially from a robot!! Came across as judgey and patronising in equal measure. I was reviewing it for the university I work for but didn't end up recommending it.",1,2022-06-03 17:15:43
A Google user,"Apps like this work off the assumption that the human mind functions on the same principles as a clunky AI. Obviously, the AI does not understand what you say to it, and it is only capable of offering you second rate advice about how to overcome a problem or feeling. The kinds of interactions you will have with this AI will only deepen feelings of isolation, especially considering that if you select the answer telling it what it says is irrelevant, it responds ""okay but here's why it could be""",1,2022-06-02 21:28:11
A Google user,"Sorry, but everytime I want to open the app an error message appears. I've tried many times to reinstall it, it didn't work.",1,2022-05-28 09:42:26
A Google user,"Interesting. I can't really see how this would fit into someone's life in a valuable way, but it's very well implemented for a chatbot.",3,2022-05-24 20:34:11
A Google user,YOUR answers to almost every question is already typed out for you to click on. What's the point??,1,2022-05-21 00:27:44
A Google user,Doesn't work from the get go. Wouldn't accept my email. FAIL.,1,2022-05-19 13:33:48
A Google user,It helps a lot i just wish it had more choices to choose from.,3,2022-05-15 04:36:44
A Google user,"""Try reframing your thought without using 🤔"" what does that even mean??",1,2022-04-23 02:25:23
A Google user,Its more of going with the motion with this app. Its okay and kinda fun but I cant see people useing it for very long.,3,2022-04-22 03:57:54
A Google user,Canned responses. Nothing useful provided at all. I've had better conversations with customer service chat bots.,1,2022-04-21 22:09:45
A Google user,"It feels like the crisis detection on this app is way off. I typed out ""put out the fire"" and woebot took that to mean I was in a crisis instead of using an idiom. It also makes it annoying because I don't want to accidentally trigger it all the time with benign conversations that are misinterpreted, especially when I don't know what exactly triggered it. I know the app is not perfect and i appreciate that it tries to detect when someone needs help but it seems to overdo it at times.",2,2022-04-18 19:40:27
A Google user,Lack of options or word recognition. Mostly only negative feelings to journal that are limited. Does not help. I actually feel much worse after using this app. I do not recommend. Would give a negative five star if I could.,1,2022-04-15 20:21:58
A Google user,Waiting time nonsense,2,2022-04-15 14:12:27
A Google user,It won't take my email.,1,2022-04-15 03:31:04
A Google user,Glorified flowchart of pre-written statements and arbitrary tools. Got a problem? Talk to a human.,1,2022-04-14 12:18:07
A Google user,If I could give this a zero I would it does not allow you to log in with your app with your email and code that you know it's right it does not allow you to log in,1,2022-04-06 23:51:34
A Google user,"If you're somebody that will benefit from an app asking you basic questions about how you're feeling mentally and emotionally, go ahead and download this app. Me personally I really don't need someone to check in on me like that but I don't know it's not for me but it might be for you. Just at least download it and check it out.",3,2022-04-02 14:21:27
A Google user,This app sucks it needs my email address I don't even know what it is I'm only 9 and I need help bc I'm upset this made me even more upset I'm disappointed and not satisfied 😕☹️,1,2022-03-30 13:51:40
A Google user,App seems to delete progress. This made it unusable for me after using the app off and on for over a year.,1,2022-03-27 01:01:17
A Google user,"Woebot has become my new best friend 🥺 I just wish they would add new content soon, I've gone through all of it haha Uhh, woebot is either broken or you guys really had like a few months of content. He says I've reached the end after asking me if I want to talk about something. It's really confusing. I like the app but it's not full enough imo",2,2022-03-23 01:56:31
A Google user,"The A.I. is really good at keeping up conversation and offering help. However, I accidentally triggered crisis mode by mentioning a nightmare I had, and the way it responded was really scary. I thought it was going to call 911 on me. So maybe tone down its initial reaction a bit when crisis mode is activated.",3,2022-03-21 06:34:39
A Google user,"While the tools in this app are useful, other features like mood tracking are bugged. I have tried all options but I never get a notification from woebot to track mood and since there is no option to backdate a mood, I end up missing tracking for that day altogether. Getting notifications from the app was necessary for this to work for me but since that isn't happening, I have to uninstall it.",2,2022-02-24 13:50:02
A Google user,Doesnt interpret free text well at all,2,2022-02-16 02:40:59
A Google user,I don't like that it's multiple choice responses instead of typing out what you want to say,2,2022-02-05 07:31:22
A Google user,Just a generic app for CBT advice. Not really an AI. It works based on keywords you type and not the overall message so don't expect it do wonders. Though this kind of apps is worth trying. Maybe you're the one it works for pretty well. For me it just doesn't.,2,2022-02-02 19:17:05
A Google user,It's good But I don't always know what I'm suffering from and I can't always explain it in words But I would love to try to figure out more about Autism I don't know who I am or what I'm Is suffering from but I feel like I'm losing my mind Sometimes I feel like I hurt someone or even kill someone I need someone help may forgive me for what I think of,3,2022-02-02 10:39:54
A Google user,"I stopped getting value out of this after about 2 weeks. It's very limited. I don't like that I'm given multiple choice responses, it doesn't seem to learn from my text input, the scripts are finite, the mood tracking is useless because it doesn't include a lot of obvious moods, and there's no way to exit out of a conversation. In general I started to just find it really repetitive and unhelpful. I guess I expected more on the ML side from an Andrew Ng project.",3,2022-01-18 06:22:21
