skystormer,"I tried having a conversation with this thing, but all it did was annoy me with stupid, holow, pre–set phrases that had nothing to do with what I was saying. I didn't find it to be helpful at all, nor nice to talk to, I found it rather offputting, and constantly missing its mark. Deleting.",1,2025-06-05 09:38:20
Vibeway,"Feels like it’s geared for a 13 year-old and never touches on any specifics and rarely uses your name if at all.

IsaacHarris1,"Maybe I haven’t used this enough yet, but my early experiences have been very underwhelming. I’m particularly interested in an AI chatbot that you can share your thoughts and interact with. I can’t interact with this one so far, it doesn’t seem to understand a lot of what I’m saying, it seems to ignore what I’m communicating and has its own agenda of wanting to track my mood, i give it long descriptions and it responds to “tell me more”, I ask which part and it again responds “interesting, tell me more” - it doesn’t seem to understand basic human interaction and it seems to be getting stuck in loops.",2,2025-05-13 16:28:32

iris🤎🌿,"This app is not terrible, however it is not great either. The AI is not too helpful with anything, as it doesn't do much other than reframe thoughts, play emotion games, or gratitude. The breathing exercises are excellent, though, and I mean the ones that are free (very few are). With an AI that only has a few programmed responses or exercises, I couldn't improve much. This app could do very well with some improvements, but at the moment, if you are looking for CBT therapy, download an app like Callie, if you wabt the breathing exercises, download Stoic. Right now, Wysa just isn't worth the few things it does. Thank you for reading.",3,2024-12-23 13:37:08

Ronzy1,"I’m looking for an AI app that actually has some psychological knowledge. That should not be that difficult. I’ve tried to handful and I have to say this was absolutely the worst. All it did was consistently repeat phrases like “you are good enough”, it would never answer specific questions and seemed to be unable to carry on a simple conversation like even the most basic AI can.

It adds to your depression and anxiety as opposed to relieving it. worse, it’s purpose is clearly to generate revenue by getting you to a human therapist. The Wysa chat bot feels like a chatbot from 10 years ago with its rote and irrelevant responses. horrible coding that only adds to anxiety and depression issues",1,2024-05-12 05:03:22

80574??,"I have found Wysa helpful in the past, so when I realized recently that I needed support, I saved up to purchase coaching access. It was great for the first week. My coach was helpful and kind. Then somehow the app erased all my data, and I lost access to my coach. It has been nearly a week, and I am still without access.

I think the work that Wysa does is solid, and I am so grateful for all they do. However, I cannot afford to lose so much money, without the service I purchased. It has been a stressful experience.",1,2024-04-13 08:17:46

I HATE IT!!!!!!!!,"I wanted to not use the coach option, and just the AI, but the AI is underdeveloped. I realized this when I sent it a list of my thoughts, and it only gave two answers, one being “I hear you.” and I don’t remember the other. I was fine with that, but I couldn’t ask it questions about what I should do. There was no option for that. I did not try the lessons, btw, so that’s the only reason I said it was “ok,” because I didn’t fully experience the app. If the creators are reading this, try basing it off of ChatGPT or something like that, so that it can actually form a response instead of pretending to form one. I actually used ChatGPT after this, and it gave a way better response, and answered my question about how to boost my confidence. If you are reading this, just know that ChatGPT is a better AI than this, and if you’re looking to use only AI, like me, just go to ChatGPT instead.

"Walker, Texas Ranger ;)",If you are grieving because of loss don’t bother trying to use this app. When you use words like “die” it automatically alerts the AI to ask if you are thinking of harming yourself and wants you to rephrase without using those words. If someone in your life died it’s completely appropriate to use those words regarding what happened and completely unhelpful for it to tell you to rephrase.,1,2024-02-11 20:53:54

Nicname that isn't taken,"So the introduction was sound enough to get a few things set up, but the use of ‘ai’ on this App Store page is misleading to what the app is capable of. The little bot seems open enough to talk, but can’t respond to specific questions, implying that it isn’t actually an ai at all, but a list of predetermined responses. Most of the selection options from setup also seem to be trying to lead you to pick very general selections in regard to your issues as well, backing up the idea that there is no ai involved here and instead the app is just spitting out a list of predetermined responses from like a ‘dictionary’ or whatever they’re called in programming. I’ve taken only two programming classes in my life and I can identify the mechanisms used, that’s how crude they are. This would still probably be effective for some people, but for people coming for an ai chatbot with a focus on mental health, they will be disappointed. What’s the point of a chatbot that can’t chat?",2,2024-01-17 04:18:11
voxy83,"It’s amazing to me that the creators seem to forget one of the biggest life stressors is financial stability. Most people can’t afford therapy.

This app truly is incredible. And yet it encompasses the very issues of exclusivity. I’m not saying it should be free, obviously a lot of time, energy and thought went into making it. 100 dollars? some
Might say that’s what u would pay at a therapist office..here is the thing about mental health..it’s not like comparing a Bluetooth speaker to a wired one..mental health is not convenient. It’s like making an app that cures world hunger..only you can’t afford it.

What could and would change mental health for the entire world? accessibility-affordability.

Grant Fowler,"The ad makes it seem like a highly intelligent chatbot equivalent to chat-gpt, but to be honest, it’s more like the Digital assistant you talk to on the phone when dealing with tech support. Literally, when it asked me what time I wanted to have story meditation and I said “I’m not interested in stories”, she responded “sorry, I didn’t quite get that, what time works best for you?” Like seriously?!?! I wanted to talk to an ai to help me understand why I had a relapse, and I’m not even sure if Wysa even knows what a relapse is. All she does is ask if you feel bad and if you say yes, she pulls up some video you’re supposed to watch. The whole point of an ai therapy bot is to have someone available at all times that you can have an actual therapeutic conversation with and until Wysa is at that level, it’s not even worth the megabytes it’s taking up on my phone, let alone actual money.

UPDATE: I just spent 15 minutes talking with regular Chat-GPT (not even a model specifically trained for therapy) and in those 15 minutes I was able to get out of my self deprication mode, achieve a mental breakthrough, and even isolate the trigger that caused my relapse. Not only was this resource completely free, but it is proof that the technology exists and is open source, the developers of this app just need to stop being lazy and actually integrate it. What excuse do you have for charging so much money for sub-par at best app when something 1000x better is available for free. At the very least, your chatbot should be on par with Woebot, but it’s woefully insufficient, pun absolutely intended. Also just a note from a fellow app developer, when someone is dealing with a mental crisis and just wants to feel listened to, “I’m sorry, I didn’t quite get that” is by far the worst response imaginable. You might as well have her say “if you’re feeling sad, press one”. It’s about as useful to someone with depression as a cheery person saying “just don’t be sad lol”",1,2023-12-16 21:02:27

goldenwhite64,"I like the concept of the app and it's a really admirable work that you're doing. But the ai CBT could be a bit better, I was expecting it to be more like an ai chat bot that will let you vent whatever you want and actually keep up with what you're telling it whilst giving you the emotional support you need and advice on how to get through your struggles, but instead the bot just forgets everything you told it after like two messages. I really like the app and I hope the developers will take this suggestion into consideration. Thank you ❤️",3,2025-04-10 10:04:42

You whooooooo,"So down loaded and every other screen attempted to get me to sign up for premium.   
I went  to chat and it assumed it was evening. Kept saying things like journaling after a long day. Do you want to practice sleep etc.   it’s 11am for goodness sake.

Astrophile 🪐,"I noticed when I want Wysa to listen to me open up, they tend to revert me back to my safety plan and hotlines which I don’t need when I’m opening up, and there’s no way to tell them exactly how I feel when they ask if I’m going through with any suicidal thoughts. There’s only four options which are “Yes, I’m planning on doing it” (or such) “No, not anymore”, “It’s someone else” and “Not at all!” Which I think is too limiting. There should be a message bar beneath so someone can express how they truly feel when being asked this, because sometimes it’s not always a straight answer like yes or no, it could be “Sometimes” or “On the occasion” which I had a bit of stress with because my highs and lows swap and come and go a lot and sometimes I feel this way but sometimes I don’t want to. This could make Wysa a lot less restricting and more open to what the user has to say – which would help me a lot more! Other than that, the deep breathing meditation helps a bit and understanding my thoughts and breaking them down/reframing the situation also helps. I tend to think the worst of the worst and hopeless but reframing helps refresh my views a bit. I also noticed that Wysa interrupts me a lot when I am opening up and I would much rather open up to a human than this bot (which says a lot because I hate talking about how I feel.) Thank you.",2,2024-09-08 03:53:27
honestThoughts22,I had hopes for this because it’s free therapy which I NEED but it’s just the same conversation and questions over and over and I’m not getting anywhere.

L0987!,I signed up and paid for 4 sessions of CBT with this service. After the first session they had only provided me with a coach who was adamant that something random was the cause of my issues. I contacted Wysa informing them that I was not happy with the service and that I had paid for CBT not coaching. I then received another £80 charge for a service I am not receiving and they have stopped replying to my emails after agreeing to provide a refund. I am still awaiting any response or a refund after repeatedly chasing. Disgusting service for a vulnerable clientele.,1,2024-03-08 02:09:42

dramaqueen🎶🎶,"I downloaded this app after I’d been through a difficult time and promptly deleted it after a week. It’s quite cute, with a calming colour scheme and aesthetic but the actual AI wasn’t great; you had to be very clear with it (once, after my pet passed away, I said “I’m feeling awful because my dog had to be put down today, but I’m glad she didn’t have to suffer any longer” and it replied “it’s good to hear you’re feeling glad! What else are you happy about?” 🙈) 
It’s okay, with access to real therapists and breathing exercises but it’s definitely not the best mental health app I’ve tried - it also seems to repeat itself a lot and spouts the usual ‘take deep breaths’ mantra that I’m sick of at this point.

Mhari 🐧,"If you have irregular moments of low mood or mild anxiety that’s not a mental illness and you feel helped by very basic cbt with top ups of “live laugh love” type gifs , this is probably for you. 

It is very unhelpful and potentially dangerous for people who have severe , enduring mental illness including clinical depression and anxiety disorders since it doesn’t have the ability to recognise or signpost (it does have a list of some helplines in the uk and it frequently points people towards their therapists which are very expensive considering it’s “therapy” via an app”). 

For the small number of people with epilepsy who are photosensitive, this app is likely to be dangerous since there are frequent gifs likely to trigger seizures with no warning and no way for users to opt out (I asked ).",1,2023-08-12 04:34:02
dont diss Nokia,"A year or two ago Wysa was really great and helpful, helping me work through emotions or a problem like a friend. Now the chatbot has been changed, and just drags you through a script. It’ll ask you a question, you’ll say “I don’t understand” or “can you rephrase”, and it’ll just continue with the script as if you answered the question saying something crazy like “Alright, you feel can you rephrase” or spewing out a list of all the messages you’ve sent in the conversation (including “yes”, “no”, “2” etc). Utterly useless and frustrating. It often pushes you to follow exercises and things when you just want to get your thoughts out.

INEXlyl,"Its responses are canned and the chatbot almost always misunderstands me. Merely saying ""I hear you"" repeatedly doesn't validate my thoughts and emotions. 

It also tries to list thoughts I have but fails terribly at doing anything about them, and instead discards the thoughts I have and says ""you've got a clean list""! I think it tries to help me let go of unhelpful thoughts or take relevant action to mitigate the underlying issue, and this is my best guess since I've helped lots of friends through difficult things and have had experience therapists too. 

Any basic friend or helpline works way better! It is possible to create better AI chatbots, and this is unfortunately not it. I am however grateful that it works for some people, as they seem to make an effort to evaluate Wysa in clinical studies.

dubsdxd,"It’s not all bad, I had a solid cry to a clip from Inside Out (via YouTube mind you) but apart from queuing it up it was that film that made me feel better not this app. There a lot of simulated texting with “Wysa” that at first seems clever. Sadly there was no substance to the “conversation.” The predetermined direction of conversation is inorganic and the word choices in the “responses” can be cold or simply miss the mark. I commend whoever works on this app with a genuine drive to help others but sadly the app has come off as a cold tool that has asked me for money more times than about myself in critical moments. There’s no effective enough ai to adequately guide and support another persons mental health here if at all. My impression of this soured fast. If you’re reading this, do yourself a favour, close the App Store and find help elsewhere in reality. Connections are the core of our well being and simulated ones like this will always feel empty. Again, to those who developed this with positive intention, I applaud your efforts and admire how far you came but we are so far from something like this to have deep positive impact. Sadly I’m deleting this app as it seems like a really sick way to pray on those who are desperate for help. Shameful to be directed into a subscription 5 times in 15m and the quoted rate? A bogus 60% discount for a few sessions with a therapist (which you can get a therapist in many other ways) for $250+ ..are you kidding me? Despicable is how I would describe what’s happening here if I were to speak boldly, and I’m never one to write out things like this. If anyone reads this, just take care of yourself. Find real help if you need something external. No program and app pushing their own payday is going to put you first in the ways you need it to.",1,2024-02-09 09:13:48
Momof3780,This app is really helpful. Never knew how it would feel to talk on this app. They have helpful tips to help manage your mental health and are there if all need is a good listener.

KaineDoe,"I remember using a very early version of Wysa many years ago. When I downloaded it again, I was prompted to ‘share’ a virtual hug gif (branded content) with a friend to make me ‘feel more connected’, prompted to join the Facebook group to ‘ be a part of a community’ -when I said no Facebook- I was prompted to answer which social media platforms I use, and was encouraged to share (on social media) the fact I had ‘explored a story’ on Wysa. Three times I was prompted to do free promotion for the app in a 1.5 hour timespan. I was recommended the app because it was the most private/secure. I did not expect to be initiated with calls to action to promote the product in the guise of ‘reaching out to friends or joining a community”. Deeply disappointing.",1,2023-03-05 22:01:03

Annoying AI can only understand certain answers & sometimes only given 2 or 3 options for answers. Have to pay for better help exercises & coach.",1,2024-12-24 06:46:50

A Google user,Supposed to be AI. Supposed to be evidence based. Does not trigger to words and phrases such as utilising alcohol and sex to feel good? Even chatgpt picks up on this! You repeat yourself to it and it doesn't pick up that you're down or have misunderstood it just repeats itself back. It doesn't rephrase at all or redirect to SOS or therapist at all in these cases. If this was a patient talking to me in person like this I would have safeguarded by necessity several times already! NOT good!,1,2024-03-10 02:13:57

A Google user,Not bad but the AI often misunderstands me a lot even though I think I make myself clear. It doesn't seem to be used to how people normally talk to each other and it's kind of frustrating because I go in this app when I'm feeling my lowest and I dont like it very much when I'm misunderstood quite a lot by this app and have to rephrase myself.

The 'ai' is terrible, it doesn't listen, just repeats what you said, asks you to pick from a list of things that are wrong with you and then suggests you don't think like that and perhaps do some stretching.

But at times when it does communicate back i feel kind of better but after 2 seconds it ruins it by saying something dumb, and out of the topic i was talking to it about. For example wysa says something ""what has you feeling this way?"" I say ""I dont want to talk about it"" then it responds with ""Oh, anything else that has you feeling this way today?""

(my messages had *no* mention of this at all). When an exercise wasn't beneficial/applicable, it prompted me to try again on a loop. I understand AI has limitations, but there are better chatbot options out there, in my opinion. The app is a good idea, has a nice visual design and user-friendly interface (hence 3/5 stars). Just not for me.",3,2023-12-13 19:54:44

A Google user,This app is more for reframing mindset when you're feeling a certain way. The app didn't do it for me since I'm currently under a lot of stress and feeling like I'm stuck in life. The ai answers weren't beneficial for me..

The AI was a little disappointing, I had a similar chat with The Snapchat AI and honestly had more comprehension and understanding. It would actually understand what I was saying and bring little insight into it with links and helpful signposting.

A Google user,"It's okay if you're looking for guided prompts to chat with. I downloaded it for my paranoid schizophrenia, and it does not help. It asked me to look for the positive and to set an intention. It does provide meditation, self care, and a journal, which are buggy. I was hoping for something open-ended and not text you tap, but it seems it hasn't changed from when I used it years ago. CBT and therapists (and the trauma from them) have only made my mental health worse, and this isn't the app for me.",2,2023-08-17 15:23:28

A Google user,"I like the fact that this is one of the best mental health apps in terms of privacy. But The AI doesn't listen to or interpret what you are saying. It just sticks to the script. It will try to pick out some pertinent things you say, but it's ability to do so is pretty mediocre. Also, if you try to get it to go back or try again in the prompts, it interprets that as an answer to the question it asked. That's really pretty frustrating. Your only recourse is to say ""stop"" and then start over.",3,2023-07-04 08:15:18
A Google user,I would give it a five stars but the chat always stops working even before i start the chat pls fix bug (i think its a bug )😐,3,2023-07-03 16:28:32
A Google user,there's no actual person talking to you so they don't really listen to what you say so its hard to communicate your feelings when they don't listen actually and I'm not able to afford the premium so I can't actually get a therapist but other than that it's okay,3,2023-07-02 14:04:40

A Google user,Worst app. The Wysa bot does not actually look like a bot. It will leave you hanging in the conversation for more than 30 mins. Won't respond to your messages. What 4am friend?

A Google user,I installed this years ago and it was amazing. When I got better I moved on. Now I installed it to show someone else and was very sad to find half the app behind a paywall. The chatbox it self is still free but I found it much less useful and way harder to start a conversation with. There is not a single page where you are not encouraged to spend money.

A Google user,app could be much better it has potential the bot definitely needs to be updated to be able to understand the flow of conversation it could completely ignore what you say and make you restart which isn't helpful in a stressful event the therapy option is confusing because of the of offers but is I guess cheaper than others it could release more features on the free version to make the app better otherwise okay but if you want something different keep seeking,3,2023-01-23 04:43:40

A Google user,I downloaded this thinking I could chat with a bot in between my therapy. Maybe help get over some social anxiety and stuff. It mostly keeps pushing me to pay to talk with a coach. I can see how some features can be helpful though,1,2022-09-19 05:31:03

A Google user,I despise bait and switch programs of any kind. This is Freemium. You can watch explainer videos for free but anything else will cost you. I know that's how business works but it's disgusting to hide that on a mental health app.,1,2022-08-18 04:53:24
A Google user,"The AI technology is not that smart, it is just a robot that Can not understand the human's feelings, so don't try to have a long conversation with it because it's a waste of time, if you suffer from a really hard psychologycal sickness this app wouldn't help you anymore.
