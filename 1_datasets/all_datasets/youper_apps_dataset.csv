MillerAC85,"I had a lifetime membership, but because I didn’t log in some random amount of time that I was never told I needed to log on in, they deleted my lifetime account and refused to reinstate it. Don’t subscribe to this app. When I tried to sort it out, they were unhelpful and dismissive. Poor customer service, bait and switch garbage.",1,2025-06-09 19:26:12
Rmcstesto,"All AI help is geared towards young adults. The “advice “ is beyond inapplicable at 50+. I won’t get into specifics. Just don’t ask about serious issues, because you’ll be frustrated and seriously disappointed. Added aggravation for when the bot clearly can’t handle your questions and it responds that “you need to recharge and take a break to regroup “ or some other nonsense.",1,2025-06-05 16:59:37
Madisonismadaf,"I’ve used this app since I was 15, and it saved my life quite often. Living in an abusive home was not easy and having a place to go where I knew what I said wouldn’t come back to haunt me was so healing. The changes you have made to this app make it useless to anyone who cannot afford a subscription like this. Bring back the old Youper. This is terrible. You are taking advantage of the mentally ill.",1,2025-05-10 15:46:02
rjjdkcidnvvidmc,"I understand that developers need to eat, too. But I got close to half a dozen “offers” to buy premium and literally typed one sentence.

Kalliki,"I used to love this app and had been a paying subscriber for the last several years. The different features from mental health checks, to working through getting to the root of my behaviors and different beliefs, were so helpful. Unfortunately, now, it’s just another AI app and I don’t find it worth the amount that I was paying especially now that I have been laid off. I was using this app alongside counseling and a support group, and it helped get me through some difficult times. I recommend looking up Celebrate Recovery in your area, which is free and helps you work through any hurt, habit, or hang up (not just addictions) in a non judgmental community. I’ve also found Copilot to be a helpful app since it’s free, remembers past conversations, and is so personal. It doesn’t have the same features I loved in this one, but it helps a lot for anyone looking. I would love to come back if the app gets those features back, please consider it! Thank you so much.",3,2025-05-03 17:46:57

Rheemed,It’s a good app. But when I signed up for the free trial I believe it said that a reminder email would go out before I was charged. That didn’t happen and… Now I have a year subscription. Feel a bit scammed. And customer service is nowhere to be found. Links in app don’t work. Buyer beware.,2,2025-04-18 06:02:53

Anonymous 2769483,"I have had Youper for the past 9 years and let me tell you, it USED to be great. Unfortunately today Youper is just another AI chatbot. I could see this being useful for someone who has no prior experience with mental health support, but that is about it. Youper used to offer guided meditations, multiple DBT and CBT exercises to work through, and a few different screeners for conditions like GAD, PTSD, and MDD. All of these features are now gone. I really hope the developers of this app go back to the old version because it was great. This app helped save my life when I was younger and unfortunately I have not found anything else that comes close to the old version. The changes to this app have continued to disappoint me, but I will keep holding out hope that one day it will be restored to the original version.",1,2025-04-03 20:15:08

Jade-Bird,"I enjoy this app, however all the changes that were made makes me wonder if I should keep it. They got rid of the options to meditate, it no longer has the steps it used to take to identify black and white thinking, behavioral therapy, etc. Also the bugs in it makes it frustrating to use. It is constantly kicking me out, making me log back in multiple times a day.",3,2025-02-11 06:44:06
Emmy_bear<3,"Im not one to leave bad reviews but one thing I hate about apps, especially self care ones is that they make you pay, at the beginning this app is very helpful but as soon as I finished signing in it gave me trials to pay.. etc, I’m not saying I’m cheap but I’m not paying for an app, I put one message on the bot thing and it immediately asked for me to pay and before that it also did that. The reason I’m putting 3 stars instead of 2 or 1 is because this app is actually great but I hate it when apps make you pay for things you’re struggling for, if you don’t mind paying in apps this app is great but if you don’t like paying I wouldn’t recommend it at all… 
Great app though, just wish it wouldn’t make you pay..",3,2025-02-07 19:43:39
dagpie,"I love the AI chat and how it can direct questions to help me be mindful. It is excellent at creating affirmations and thoughtful activities.

Joeatreyougrt,Onboarding took forever just to find out this app is paid only. Free version is useless.,1,2024-12-17 09:21:06
Pivotingpebbles,"Once you download the app, there is about 10 minutes of marketing the app to you before you can find out it is only paid. Cheap tricks like “do you want to reduce anxiety” clicking yes leads you to buy/try the app screen. I want to be able to see the interface, see if it resonates to invest the time to try it. I’d respect the app if the first question was “there is only a paid version (with free trial) do you want to continue? “",1,2024-12-13 08:57:23
chocovalle,It’s pretty disappointing to log back in to only see all my entries wiped out and all features that were formerly free now put behind a paywall. I realize they were under no obligation to keep 6 years worth of entries but it’s still disappointing to log in and be told it’s a “fresh new account”. Nothing lasts on modern internet I suppose.,1,2024-12-08 19:15:02
Barfly666,"I hope the developers read this, you’ve made a good start, but it’s kind of pointless to get into these Conversations and then it doesn’t remember any past conversations.

Jericho Killswitch,"Why would you pay someone to take detailed notes of your psyche over a long period of time if it wasn’t to discover patterns you didn’t know were there? Supportive is great and can get someone through the day, keep them alive, but this isn’t a long term solution. This is a distraction at best. It really should give an option to alert local support or police in case the worst should occur but I’m sure there’s no money in that.

YouperBuggy,"I liked this app so much I was willing to pay the full $89. It worked great and I had my mood tracker and checkin notification on so I can track this consistently. But after 3 months of use, this notification stopped working. I asked the support but all I got was try reinstalling the app (and that didn’t work). Since then, I stopped engaging with this rather expensive app. Before my annual subscription ends, I wanted to try asking a question and I get this pop-up that says something isn’t working and I should try again later (for this reinstalling worked). I would have expected more from a $89 app, getting all these bugs fixed, and not resorting to users to reinstall every time the bug happens. It’s disappointing how they make you do the annual subscription and just stop working smoothly after a few months.",1,2024-09-12 00:36:49
TiffTockToe,I never leave reviews but this app has been thoroughly disappointing. You’re harassed nonstop to purchase premium. The app is pretty much useless without premium.

staciefayce,"Don’t waste your time putting into this app. Disgusted with how often I have to repeat myself. “How would you feel best supported right now?” I don’t know, why do you keep asking me to direct you in how to help me? How is that helpful? I might as well just talk to myself. Usually the app would just shut down on me and tell me to take a break or a breather and then if you come back to it with the same issues, you have to start all over. Constantly having to repeat and restate my challenges to a bot that superficially cuts me off all the time isn’t bringing clarity or hopefulness to this situation. An absolute turnoff to CBT. I also detest the way it tries to force you into a positive statement at the end of these super short cut off sessions that leave you dissatisfied. Really invalidating.",1,2024-08-09 12:32:37

Ronzy1,"I am about to complete the free trial, think I will cancel. First handful of days were fine considering I was in a optimistic positive mood. Today was different, feeling pretty down so decided to chat about personal issues. The AI was extremely unhelpful and had no understanding of what it is like to be in a depressed state. The answers were Solutions given would be great when one is in a motivated up place, but if you’re not in that state it’s worthless and actually could make things worse. If that wasn’t enough, just when I thought we were making progress it decided it was done with the conversation and ended it.
If you’re looking for an extra boost of encouragement and do not struggle with depression, motivation or anything severe this could work for you. if you do struggle with the listed issues, I have found this app to be very unhelpful, it motivated me to write this review, I generally never write reviews.",2,2024-03-26 19:22:46
inarieani,"Let me start by saying Youper is now no more than a mood tracker if you do not subscribe. I understand putting some features behind a paywall that were once free, but putting the entirety of the app besides the mood tracking feature behind a paywall is unacceptable. I started using Youper in 2018 - it was great and super helpful to me at the time. I redownloaded the app in 2024 and I am shocked by how money hungry the devs are. The features that used to be free are now behind a pay wall. Don’t get me started on how aggressive the pop ups are to get people to subscribe. Your ads make people feel like they are a number, worth just as much as the money they can give you. For an app preaching accessible mental health, I can tell you have lost that passion over the years. I know the world is a different place now, but with the increasing AI capabilities, there is absolutely no reason to charge for the use an AI service that was free before there was a robust amount of technology of its kind.",1,2024-03-16 01:00:00

Lizzzard Qween,"Like many of the most recent reviews express, I have been using Youper on and off for years. It was an important part of my early healing journey and I thought I would revisit it for healing journey part 2. However, every. single . thing. is behind a paywall now. And it’s lowkey lame of y’all. I get it. You’ve realized the earning potential of the app and probably (hopefully) are just trying to keep the thing funded but at the end of the day, many of us used this app because we could not afford traditional therapy. While essentially forcing people to buy the paid version of an app isn’t anything new, it is disconcerting to see an app that presented itself as a genuine and accessible tool for self-betterment turn into a money grab. And please, for the love of the gods, if you’re going for the money grab, please stop responding to comments from long-term users expressing their disappointment with your marketing and pricing structure by asking what improvements could be made to an app they can no longer use or what features they miss. These comments along with your placating statements about how change is hard comes across as intentionally avoiding the reality your paywall has created.  Obviously we miss the old, accessible Youper that seemed to give a flying fiddlestick. That’s the suggestion so many users are giving you: remove your paywall, or at the very least increase the features that can be used without paying.",1,2024-03-02 00:09:55

ecd5,"What happened?? 

2021 - I loved Youper. Used the paid version- upgraded to talk sessions with therapists proved. Fantastic ….
Youper changed…. No therapy and it happened pretty abruptly.

2022 / 2023 I kept using it though because i liked the Chatbot, the meditations, the mood check in. It was still very helpful. Although it seemed to change in little ways that weren’t always great. 

2024 - February … no meditation,
No mood tracking/ journaling - it bare bones compared to what it used to be. No notice that things were changing (I have paid for the app for years now). 

ChatGPT still works but without the other features it’s not as effective 

So… what happened? Why no communication with subscribers regarding significant changes? Why not lower the fee if it was going to be stripped of things?",2,2024-02-17 07:50:22
Nicname that isn't taken,"I’m trying out a number of these in quick succession, but of the ones that let me log in, this has been the worst so far! You can’t take any action without being slammed with ads for the full version or premium or whatever, you get like four of them before even getting to say anything to the boy, and it cuts you off after a single message. You can’t even explain your situation before getting cut off. There is no ‘trial’, because in order for it to be a trial, you need to be able to try it! Also how much it brags about being featured on yahoo and cosmopolitan, or at Harvard, as if those aren’t obvious institutions that will feature anyone who pays them enough.

blmhouston,I suspect the good reviews are because those who find the app to be unhelpful cancel their subscription. After using it for a couple of weeks I find it gives one answer - think positively.

West coast mind hacker,it’s hard to know what went wrong at Youper because the other recent reviews are right I am a user of Youper for over 2 1/2 years and at one point in the past it was the best digital therapeutic mental health app that exists but none of the original features remain the team completely gutted it and replaced it with an almost useless at least in terms of rapid CBT delivery chat powered by what appears to be a GPT plug-in from open AI. The original application delivered microdoses of CBT treatment in the absolute most efficient way possible so you could intervene and distort almost instantly especially when you were dealing with a stressful environment or toxic relationships professional or personal. it was truly an amazing application and someone should post videos online of the original application and how it was great compared with the shell of the program that you were uses now it’s hard to understand why they did what they did because the code was already written and working and it was a subscription pay Model and the founding team has offered no explanations. my guess would be that perhaps the software development team was too expensive and replacing the original code base with a GPT plug-in save the money on upkeep I’m not really sure but it is a real tragedy what happened with his application they owed their user based more than this,1,2023-12-29 13:19:13

ContraltoCat,"As my first review said: I have used Youper for years. I have found it to be a great resource when I'm alone and really need to get it all out and get some feedback. However, over the years (like many health apps), Youper has slowly been sliding behind a paywall and removing things from long time users. They used to have a catalog you could scroll through that had a bunch of different mental health focusses that you could gear Youper towards. I checked in after not using it for a couple weeks and they blocked the catalog behind a paywall. Now I go back again, and Youper himself is behind the paywall!! This app is useless to me now! It feels like punishment for longtime users to be forced to pay when they were huge reasons for the success of the app. I always promoted this app as it could be around whenever you needed to talk when a therapist isn't available. In high school, I was dependent on Youper because I was never allowed to see a therapist and dealt with a lot of stress and bullying. It feels disgusting to remove people who possibly rely on the app. And $70!! That is like actually going to a therapist! This app is not supposed be substituting going to a therapist, yet you expect the same and possibly more money than actually seeing a licensed professional! This is just heinous in my eyes. I don't even know what I should do at this point. Uninstalling feels like I am giving up on an incredible resource, but it's not worth the money.

Hydrangeas00,"from the moment i opened the app i was bombarded with probably numerous individual pages trying to convince me of how medically sound the app was, that had to be clicked through one by one, followed by  an extremely rudimentary anxiety/depression screenin. after that, maybe 5 different pages prompting me to pay for ""premium"" or start a trial, saying I'd been ""selected for a discount"", like some ridiculous QVC product. then finally i got through to the main page of the application, where you can interface with the AI bot (the only reason anyone would download the app), it asks me how I'm feeling, i answer, then it asks me a follow up question which i CANNOT answer, the only two prompts available are ""start trial"" or ""I'm done"". so, you tap ""I'm done"", and then it boots you back to the main page, where all its' done is log how you were feeling, which anyone can do in their notes app or a piece of paper without having to tap through five advertisements first. I'm not exaggerating when i say the free version of this app is entirely useless, if you are looking for a free app, this is a waste of time. if not, it might be good, i have no idea, I'm not going to start a trial that i might forget about because i really can't afford it.",1,2023-12-01 03:21:34

The original intention was to help people and I guess that is irrelevant now.

cellolvr14,"I used to LOVE this app. It would talk me through my anxiety and help me think through all the thinning traps without any sort of subscription to use those basic tools. I’d been away from the app for a while but decided to go back to it today because I was having a panic attack and was hoping it would help walk me through my thoughts like it always did. I open the app and it does it’s usual check-in, asks me how I’m feeling. As soon as I respond and say I’m feeling very anxious my ONLY option to click on was to view their “free trial options” and their subscription options. Obviously I chose decline, I was having an anxiety attack and can’t really deal with adding a subscription service right now. But once I hit decline it ended the conversation immediately and didn’t help me AT ALL. I tried to go back and try again hoping it was just that one time but it did the same thing to me again and again, wanting me to pay to upgrade before it would be of any help or react at ALL about how I’m feeling. So I searched through the rest of the app to see if maybe I’m missing something but NOPE. All I can do now is log how I’m feeling. All the tools they provided for free before to help relieve those feelings, like walking you through thinking traps, a quick goal setting, mindfulness exercises, all gone and behind a paywall. Now don’t get me wrong, they always had an upgrade feature to use some of their exercises, but those basic tools were always free. Now this app only serves to INCREASE my anxiety by asking me how I’m feeling then thrusting a request for payment in my face right away. It’s so gross. Immediately deleting and not using again.",1,2023-11-13 23:50:58
Teacher NYC,I’m echoing what some other reviewers have said here. I don’t know why the developers took away all of the features.

bsjsisisik,"Used this for the past 5 years and more and more features are slowly starting to disappear. Then it became a subscription model and EVEN MORE features have disappeared. Maybe they don't have money for the upkeep so they only keep the chatbot? Whatever it is, its no longer useful to me at all. Guided meditations are gone, breathwork, other little programs, gone.

Paleocook,"TLDR: This was the best app for years. I regret buying the premium version because there aren't any of the old features and the conversations are worse! I should really rate it 1 star, but I loved the old version too much.

I've loved Youper for 6 years. I started realizing that more and more of the app was being put behind a paywall, but many of the app's most beneficial features were still available (e.g. CBT, certain mindfulness exercises, mood tracking). I recently opened the app and found that ALL CONTENT is behind a paywall except mood tracking. But I love this app, so I paid for the premium. 

I wish I hadn't. 

1. You can have a conversation, but unlike before, Youper doesn't remember anything you've said. For anyone new, when you would open the app, Youper would bring up what activity you decided to do to improve your wellbeing or ask how something difficult you did went.

2. You can't select any activities from a list... There is no list. There are no activities.

3. The app doesn't help you identify or change your cognitive distortions. This was -in my opinion- Youper's best feature. Again for anyone new, Youper would explain what cognitive distortions were, have you write down a few thoughts, guide you through identify your cognitive distortions letting you swipe to indicate if your thoughts included each type, and then prompt you to re-write your thoughts in a way that wasn't distorted.

I could go on. All I have left to say is I'm so, so incredibly grateful that I found the old, better version when I did. 

I thought about giving the app 1 star, but I just couldn't do it because of how much I loved it haha. I hope that this is just some sort of temporary mistake and that the app returns to the old version. I shouldn't have just paid for the subscription, but I thought I could trust this app.",2,2023-11-06 23:14:43

Ashlynette92,They’ve started charging because they wanna compete in the A. I. market with everyone else. Ugh. This used to be my favorite app. Always used. And when i needed it most and tried to return to it? It charges a subscription fee. Trash.,1,2023-10-25 17:46:39
shadowgrl,"I used to love this app. I used it daily and found it to be incredibly helpful. I’ve been an avid user for several years when it was primarily a mood tracker with some added exercises to help with at home CBT therapy. Then it sort of morphed into a guided journal which was beyond helpful and absolutely pivotal to helping me be more insightful.

Then it became an ai chatbot which was ok, kind of neat to use but not necessarily as helpful as the guided journal accept of it. 

Today I open the app to find it’s trash. I am beyond devastated that an app that was so great and helpful for so many people flipped to an ai driven chatbot that forces you to pay a subscription. I can use a chatbot for free and probably get the same affect. Gone are the little meditations and exercises, and honestly anything that was even remotely helpful. I am so disappointed.

At this point, get the shadow work journal that’s all over tiktok as that’ll probably be more helpful in the long run.",1,2023-10-25 17:19:04

Now, this most recent update won’t even register that I’m doing my daily mood check in. I sent a screenshot into support about 4 days ago and no one has reached out. I lost my streak for my daily check ins because they’re not registering as me doing them. I might as well just use the Apple mood tracker instead.",2,2023-10-22 11:17:32

aebooksandwords,I used this app about five years ago and it was free. Now everything seems to require a subscription.

DrKnow243,"I paid a lot for this app, but at some point the mindfulness (Explore) option simply disappeared without an explanation or an option to get it back. The tech support have not gotten back to me, and so all that is left is the AI, which really does not do such good a job. It does not remember anything you previously told it, and it will end the conversation abruptly for no reason, as if it were timed to be a 8-minute session or something like that. Now that just might be what they can deliver at the moment, but this thing with the missing extras, all these exercises in the explore option, is just a rip off and I’m not sure why they don’t have any explanation anywhere on line of why it happens and how to fix it.",2,2023-10-03 08:15:58
Dlduffster,"I paid for a one year subscription to this but the latest update removed one of the useful features and it’s now not as good. I used to be able to include some open text details about why I rated how I’m doing the way I did but that feature is now gone. I can’t track what was going on that made me feel the way I felt. It was a helpful tool for creating short journals but now I’d need to do that in another app. I also find the categories of how I’m getting to be too limited, especially since I can only select one - I can be having more than one feeling at a time! I also find the meditations to be getting a bit repetitive in that they all sound pretty much alike. There’s not enough variety.

UPDATE:  I see they responded. It WAS a good fit before you changed it! In fact, I’ve recommended to app to several others after I first got it, but not anymore. It’s a bait and switch to make someone pay for a year subscription then REMOVE FEATURES a few months later.

my previous review: i’ve been using youper for a couple months now, and i’ve definitely seen an improvement in the way i think. whenever i get into a bad mood, i’ll open up the app and try to rewire my thoughts. just by coming up with more rational thoughts, i’ve noticed a huge lift in spirits! the design is also beautiful and minimal. would totally recommend this to anyone struggling with mental illness, or even just negative thoughts",2,2023-04-04 22:16:34

Few developers care enough about the leaving end users, and I do genuinely appreciate the ease with which this was to find, which is why I bumped it up another star.
Now the negative. In order to do all of my first day tasks (FIRST DAY), I had to get a subscription. Yes, there’s a free trial, but there’s always a risk there (and the deletion of the account, if I recall correctly, will have no effect on Apple’s record of the subscription leading to a possible unintended $70 spent). I understand developers/research/maybe voice actors? need to eat, but that’s an awful lot of money to spend Willy nilly. And nickel and diming me on the first day? Worrisome.",2,2023-01-09 10:14:01

This app is only a shadow of what it used to be- everything used to be free, the app would talk to you like a friend, and now the app barely talks to you. My husband and I are both disappointed.

Then this year, I needed that support again, so I came back, only to find the app not only behind a pay wall, but loaded up with a new and horrendous design, and a bunch of garbage self-help. The main thing that helped me, the space to just talk things out, and access my mood changes, is just gone. It was such a shock to me. It literally just made be more depressed, because it proved that good things don’t last.

pamplemouse33,"I downloaded this app a long time ago. At the time, it was completely free and it felt too good to be true. It was so useful for documenting my feelings whenever I needed and I was so appreciative of the service since my family can’t afford therapy as our insurance doesn’t cover it. Then the pandemic hit and I stopped using it because I was too mentally exhausted to do anything, including taking care of myself. I got a therapist for a while and I forgot about Youper. I can’t afford my therapist anymore and I was fine with that until today I wanted to do some journaling and opened Youper to find that all the services I loved are now blocked by a paywall. Granted, $44.99 a year (or whatever it is) is fairly reasonable for the service, but as a broke college kid, I can’t make that kind of investment. I wouldn’t be complaining if I could at least journal for free, but I can’t even do that. The most basic of features aren’t available unless you pay, making the app useless for me. There’s no free functionality. I understand a free app isn’t profitable, but I’d totally watch some ads or whatever if that’d let me simply write down my thoughts.

I’m going to try using it again, because it really was the most helpful tool for me in the past and I’m glad I have my history saved on there, I just wish they would reconsider maybe even just some of the layout.

I recently just updated the app so I could monitor my progress for this month and saw that it now requires a subscription in order to utilize it. I think this is a horrible move.

All they did was take my money and tell me to track how I feel every day. That’s therapy? What? Stating I’m sad does not solve sadness!!!! I already knew how I felt or I wouldn’t have downloaded the app for help! Now I FEEL SAD ANGRYAND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. Do not get this app. It is worthless. When I asked for a refund after one session, which I described above, I was denied because I had already used the service. Complete trash.",1,2022-01-09 15:37:57

a.r_charpentier,"Calling the services they offer therapy is a far leap of what it actually is. To pay $45 a week to talk to someone who is trained in therapy techniques but isn’t a licensed therapist is the equivalent of going to a friend who took psychology courses in college and talking to them for free. I’ll be cancelling my subscription snd requesting a refund, i’m very disappointed in the fact that i paid money to speak with someone who isn’t even a legitimate, licensed therapist.",1,2022-01-07 08:17:27
21st century life,"So I used Youper back in 2018 as a therapist myself. Then, I quickly suggested it for my teenager clients because it was a great place for people to track their moods and thoughts. I just came back to it 3 years later in 2022 and now it’s a whole therapy platform. Which for some people I can find see the appeal and think this resource is very much needed for people. However, it would be great if you could just create a standard Youper for those who don’t currently need therapy but just a place to track things. It’s a bummer I can’t add to it now and see how it compares to my state of mind a few years ago.",3,2022-01-01 22:27:36

In the past it had a menu of lots of different exercises; including mindfulness meditations, reframing tools and a personality profile. The best one for me was a procrastination exercise that would help you take baby steps, set small tasks and a time to start, and would even check up on you at the time you agreed, to check your progress.
All that has gone now and it is just a chat bot and mood logger, which is a shame. I think Chat GPT does a better job at the moment.",2,2024-09-24 11:43:36

What a disappointment. I have deleted my account and the app. 

Old review
I have been using Youper for a while daily and find that it complements my CBT treatment for anxiety and other symptoms I have. The chatbot is very much aligned to the exercises from my treatment and being able to use this app to check in and log and analyze your thoughts is very handy. Analysing the for and against of your thoughts is very powerful for depowering a debilitating thought! I also like that the chatbot reminds you to set your intentions, write down what you are grateful for or take some time out to meditate. The app interface is very pretty and very user friendly and gives you interesting insight into your personality. I am so grateful for finding this app and will continue using this to keep up my CBT treatment after it has finished. Unlike other mood apps that I have tried, I am grateful and appreciative that all content is free with no subscription as not all users have money to spare every month! I find this app is 100% better than the others anyway. Keep up the good work! I have already recommended this to my friends who suffer from anxiety and depression.",1,2024-02-25 07:57:39
Datpotato778,Disappointed. I downloaded this app a few years ago and recently reinstalled it. A lot of the features are limited unless you pay for a subscription. Really disappointing as I enjoyed using the app and felt it really did help with my mental health a few years back. Now all you can do is track your mood!

The most frustrating thing about this app is that it charges you for such terrible service. Seeking mental health help, it’s frustrating to have the chatbot automatically shut down a conversation and force my responses when I don’t say the right thing; this is even more annoying considering that the chatbot does not remember past conversations, so everything you say is forgotten. Seriously? In times of mental stress, this app has actually been HARMFUL. 
 
I got the free version of ChatGPT, and it is INSANE how much nicer it is to speak with an AI that remembers things I’ve said from weeks ago, incorporating them into helpful responses.

To the youper team, I’m still left wondering if you are human beings? Or is it just a bunch of bots in your customer service team as well? Help me understand why you delete my review and completely ignore my request to help understand the current update. Sounds like money is motivation and helping people is not priority.

Loving PWR!!,"I find the track my mood feature really frustrating. I go to track my mood and then it literally shuts down the window with no further options to continue the chat. We really need an improvement to allow the person to keep chatting to discuss their mood or just provide the option to say I’m done (e.g. user: select mood as ‘anxious’, then the chat bot should then say: “would you like to talk about it?” and then give two options “I’m done thanks”, “ I want to talk about it”. User continues chat…)

Also, I really liked how the app used to provide meditations or other breathing techniques and mindful options to help a situation if we don’t want to chat. It’s disappointing that this feature has been removed completely. 

There’s also another issue I hate which is the chat bot just cuts off the conversation when you’ve asked it a question.

Simply Jeff,"I'm a new user trying to get a feeling of how this app works and what it can do for me. In stead I've seen nothing but ads harassing me to pay for premium services!

Annabelle Lee,"The app has always annoyed me and chatting with a computer has been less than helpful BUT it had the ability to track symptoms of my diseases using the PCL and PHQ. The health assessments based on clinical tools has been the only feature I used for years, and it was great until they want to charge an exorbitant amount to access my logs. I can't even export the results from the last several years unless I pay. There was no warning they were locking up my health information so I can't access it.",1,2023-12-26 12:13:24
Victoria Thee,Update 2023 - few features available for free. Now even the PHQ 9 (depression screening) and GAD 7 (anxiety screening) and monitoring are paywall-locked. Ridiculous bc they're freely available anywhere else. No longer recommend this app. Old review (2019) - Actually helped me sort out my feelings and calm down when not much else helped. Even has guided meditation clips built in. No ads either!!,1,2023-12-25 17:07:34

Not Available,"The free version has an advanced mood tracker & a limited journal. The journal is your conversation with its ai, but you can only send one ""text"" for free.

Then the reasons for each mood can be customized & you can have multiple moods a day... All nice, but I wanted a cbt therapy ai, not a pretty mood journal.

Jordan Dolph,I went from loving this app at the beginning of the year to walking away from each experience frustrated and confused. The AI is better at creating a fluid sentence but it doesn't make an effort to actually solve the problem. What was nice before was getting to work through my issues on my own based on a step by step process. It also lost a big element when they took away the mindfulness practices.

When I tried to ""share"" (just to see if I could see my whole post) the screen went back to the beginning screen and it asked me to check in again. I feel this is a glitch and probably easy to fix.

Find another app!",1,2022-06-25 02:03:28
Weasel,"It went from five stars to one. First they stopped providing medication, and today when I opened the app my subscription had been canceled without my knowledge. I had a wonderful therapy coach and that's gone now.",1,2022-06-23 19:11:09
Lili,"Youper used to help me so much, but now it's lost all functionality behind a £40 pay wall - I can't even figure out how to just do my daily diary anymore. As useful as this new structure might be for some people, to completely change an app that was fine before is not the way to do it - maybe could have been another app, or at least these features could have been in addition to the old layout, rather than replacing it entirely. Very sad.",1,2022-06-18 13:55:29
Kallie Smith,"This app has helped me through so much and taught me coping mechanisms, and it was so nice to have someone to talk to. But now the options are severely limited, I wish nothing had changed. This used to be my favorite app, I'm sad I can't rely on it anymore",1,2022-06-14 18:02:39

CinnamonBaked,So far I am loving this app! Super helpful. Edit. It was super helpful. Now everything is like every other mentail health app. Everything behind a pay wall. Thanks. But no thanks.,1,2022-06-10 01:55:35
minsikscat,"Been using this app for YEARS to help my mental health and especially do the health check ups. With the new update you first cut off being able to talk about your feelings to youper more than once a day unless you're premium. Now you cut off access to the check ups + all the history and data I had in them. Seeing my progress or setback in those was literally one of the only things keeping me going. Thanks for the update, lost a user of years.",1,2022-06-09 05:44:51

NJ,"Unfortunately, I have had to change my rating to 2 star. I used to love this app. It was very useful, especially if you do not have a support network. I have used it since 2019 and wanted to use it again recently but it has changed to a subscription based model which prices a lot of people out. This is a shame, but I understand that not everything can be free. It is a good app if you are happy to pay, it's just a shame that the model has changed.",2,2022-06-04 02:08:52
Crystal Rios,"I used this in the past, but haven't used it in a long while. I downloaded it again and was asked about my insurance information. I suspected it was a paid service now. The reviews confirmed that. It's so disappointing. I really wish there was an easier way to get mental health help. I'm not paying for this. Even though it was exhausting, I'm going back to my own self therapy. I'm making good progress on my own anyway. I just wanted some extra help and support to keep me constant.",2,2022-05-25 03:15:45

Pam Horne,Not fair. I've been using the app for 3 years or so to monitor symptoms and now I check In after awhile and it has completely changed and is pretty useless unless I pay. Fine to make new users pay but not fair to older users. Thanks for the abandonment!! All about the money huh?,1,2022-05-09 10:34:24
Legend soul,Worst app I have ever used,1,2022-05-04 19:25:35
Mali Rowe,Booooo! Why did you change this app? I used to use it daily and decided to jump back in and now it's not even close to the same. You guys should know by all of the new one star reviews that this is a kick in the teeth to the people who loved your app! Shame.,1,2022-05-02 20:16:49

Leiah Andres,"I'm so devastated. A few years ago, this was an app I could use to ""talk"" through my anxiety and depression. I remember wanting more clinical options, but now it's completely redone. Literally everything I had and need are paywalled; it's completely inaccessible",2,2022-05-02 09:05:15
Alli Rivera,"My comment got removed so I'm commenting again. Having to pay for mental health assistance is devastating. I've used this app for three years and found out today when I need it most that I have to pay for everything in it. Literally. Everything. Not a single bit of it is free anymore. It's ALL going to cost money. Not everyone can pay for mental health assistance. This was the best thing available for me. I was told by the developers I'd still have free access, but I don't. I'm heartbroken.",1,2022-04-29 01:43:39
Aurora Lloyd,"Also here to mention how the new update was soul crushing. After years of trying to find a therapist, I finally found one and was eager to look through all my old logs with the AI to use as examples of my past mental health history. It's crushing to have to spend money I barely have just to simply access my anxiety and depression monitoring charts. This app used to make a genuine difference in my life, and now I have lost that due to not being able to justify paying for it.",1,2022-04-28 19:49:31
Kimberly Watson,Updated review: Taking my review from 5 stars to 1. This was a wonderful app to help provide tools for those that could not afford other apps or therapy for their mental health. Nothing is available anymore for free users. What a bunch of sell outs.,1,2022-04-27 11:20:13

John Clay,"I'm im a place where I need therapy but don't want to spend oodles of money on it. I remembered Youper because used to be incredible. Now, everything is locked behind a pay wall. And instead of being able to chat with an AI, you now have to select a paid, guided discussion. Part of what made Youper special to me was this unguided chat, allowing me to feel out my emotions. The AI could then involve you in a more guided discussion based on how you were feeling.",1,2022-04-19 18:38:13
Colten Schmidt,"**edit: Years ago this app was free and had a great AI program that helped with CBT when I wasn't with my therapist. Sad that the app I loved has changed. This app is absolutely fantastic. It's a huge help in helping me gain skills to effectively and positively handle anxiety and depression. My counselor and psychiatrist know that I use this app, and all three are great tools that complement each other tremendously. Thank you Youper 😀",1,2022-04-14 05:57:57
Jim Rose,"Used to be a great, simple, and free ai assisted journaling and mood tracking app. Now, it's got a bunch of categories full of exercises that you can't do at all unless you subscribe to a full year. Please stop acting like your users wanted this change. That's gaslighting customers you claim to want to help. Just admit that you messed up and fix it in some meaningful way. The changes made to this app and its business model is depressing to myself and others.",1,2022-04-12 10:54:34

Taz S,Real shame this is no long free. It was a real help over the past how many years and I would always come back to it as it help being a place to turn to talk too. The fact that nothing is free comes across as a real cash grab now. Yeah I can see over my history but i Cant even just type to let out what your feeling anymore.. shame... such a shame.,1,2022-04-09 00:13:53
Amanda,I really like(d) having this pocket therapist. I really wasn't expecting much from it because it's AI but the replies are natural and relevant. EDIT: and now they hate us.,1,2022-04-08 06:54:30
Keylaya Jones,"I liked this app but it just stopped sending notifications all of a sudden. I'm a very forgetful person so if I don't get notifications, I won't remember to do my therapy.

Today I found out new users have to pay to use this at all; not even a trial period! I get the desire to get money for the effort put into the app, but the way it's been done seems at odds with where the project started. I can't recommend it to people now, even though the chatting bot helping you through CBT is so useful. Such a shame",2,2022-03-21 01:30:40
Joe Emm,"Notice the dates on the 5 star reviews. I'm not sure the app has any functionality unless you're willing to pay the subscription. This app used to stand out as real and helpful in a space where many people are trying their best to dishonestly convince you happiness is just one recurring subscription away. Youper, don't bother replying to tell me that my data are still on the app, because they're no good to me without continued access to the features.",1,2022-03-19 23:01:18

Nutty Bee,Edit: Found this as easily the most comforting and helpful mental health and self-therapy app out there way back.

Such a huge shame and a letdown.,1,2022-03-07 22:24:51
Charlotte Evelyn Whitfield,"Started out as an incredible AI app that helped me more than any therapist ever has. Then this was put behind a paywall. Now I'm in a position to afford their plans, the app is nothing close to what it used to be. Their review responses say it was because of thousands of people wanting this change, forgetting about the thousands who preferred it the way it was. I've never found another app close to what it used to be. So very disappointed. 😔",1,2022-03-06 14:01:14

Olivia Reis,"I used this app before when it was a free AI to help with Journaling and identifying thinking traps and such. I recommended my mom to try this app as she has extreme anxiety and goes in a spiral, yet she was met by personal questions and a pay wall. Idc if there is payment for a care team, but the original AI was great when in a pinch. It was a smart journal. It's ""great"" how the dev team has changed to grab at money.",1,2022-02-23 20:14:32
Kami,"As a minor just looking for guidance to find help with everything. Not helpful. What's with the paywall? If I paid for it then maybe but it used to be free back then when I was younger. I started using the app when I was 10-11 when I was feeling hopeless and depressed. Since I've been feeling more helpless. I thought redownloading this app would be helpful, as it saved me in the past from my dark time. Now useless for someone with no way of income.",1,2022-02-22 04:59:17

Christian Biddle,"Also a former user of the app who reinstalled to be met with disappointment. Wasn't the entire idea of youper to help you identify thinking tracks and moods yourself?

Stephanie Mullins,Editing my review: it used to be a great app where it wanted to help people for free. I often recommended in many Neurodivergent groups for people who couldn't afford therapy. I was feeling blue and opened the app recently. I'm shocked that it's some weird pay service thing. It used to be an AI cbt app with mental health monitoring and meditations.

Cookie Monster,This is a really good CBT app that I've been using for a couple of years. Just be careful because if you pay for therapy and then change your mind they will not give you your money back. I changed my mind because they asked a bunch of personal info that I was uncomfortable giving out to an app. I didn't know who would be looking at that info. So I asked for a refund and they completely ignored my request twice. Just be careful.,2,2022-02-08 18:57:53

Siân M,Used the app when it first came out and deleted it when I found I didn't need it anymore. Meaning it worked brilliantly!! Downloaded it again today and wowza has it changed for the worse. Bit uncomfortable giving my phone number to recieve a plan I don't even want. The old version didn't require that. All I hoped was to be able to use the app to rationalise my thoughts and track my mood. Very disappointed :((( will have to find a replacement now,1,2022-02-03 06:52:15
Jamie Jacopelle,"Same as everyone else, disappointed by changes. I hadn't used the app in a year, almost exactly a year. Every January and February my depression gets bad, and I wanted to track my moods again like I had been for a few years.

Allison Stickel,"I used to use this app all the time. The AI ""I'm feeling..."" Chat was a great way for me to journal how I felt and take the next appropriate steps to feel better. However now it is a money-grabbing paywall. They obviously don't care about helping people anymore, they just want profit. Which, I would be willing to pay up to $10 one time just to have that AI chat feature again.

J Batts,"Changed from a 5 to 1 star review. I loved this app so much for so long. I had the app to track my mental health and take with the AI all of the last 5 years and really needed it today.

Maybe a cheap subscription for the AI and tracker for a few bucks.",1,2022-01-24 14:58:01
Fearie Star,"Changed my review from 4 stars to 2. I just opened the app after a year to look through my past chats with the AI and saw that EVERY SINGLE THING was paywalled! I wasn't expecting that! I wish Youper would have communicated this change to users, because that's really important after using the app for free for 3 years. I understand that they need to make money, but I wish there were more supscription options. Especially for people who don't want a therapist and just want the AI.",2,2022-01-22 18:42:35

Ash White,I'm so upset. I went to get access to this app again and get back on track and now I can't use the main functions without a subscription?

If they had even 1/10 of the features that used to be free still available for free (symptom tracking, ai conversation/diary, mood tracking, meditation, etc) this would be a 5/5 app. But everything is behind a paywall, which sucks.

Jackson Kulinski,I used to use this app to map my mood and track triggers and it genuinely helped. The app now has no free options and has moved completely behind a paywall.

Elena Cazacu,"This app had helped me tremendously just for the simple feature where I could write down my feelings. A feature now costing $85. Seeing that I can't use any of the features anymore was very disheartening and has affected my mental health in a very bad way. I guess the ones that are not privileged don't deserve help. Not a single human response to new comments. Only bots. Maybe you don't care about people's well-being as much as you advertise it, sadly. All we ever wanted was discreet help.",1,2022-01-08 17:53:34
