  Description: Exploring and comparing negative review "pain words" across major
  complaint themes in both Conversational and Baseline mental health app datasets
  using TF-IDF. Includes visualizations highlighting the emotional fingerprints
  of user frustrations.

  Methodology:  
  * Uses sentiment analysis (VADER) to identify the most negative reviews per
  theme.  
  * Applies TF-IDF vectorization to extract the top weighted words and phrases
  driving negative sentiment ("pain words").  
  * Visualizes findings with interactive bar charts using Plotly.
