being987,"i was a long time user of the app - i used the free version from 2012-2017, and then purchased a lifetime subscription in 2017. i also gifted year subs for several friends. it was my favorite app until i discovered tamara levitt is openly zionist. she literally follows the state of israel on her ig. maybe that’s unfortunately not surprising given the tech industry, not to mention jay shetty is a scammer who takes other people’s experiences and plagiarizes them for his social media content (also think about it - what actual monk would decide to go corporate and have an incredibly expensive and inaccessible “school” for coaches - scam, money grab). it creeps me out to think of all the daily meditations i had listened to with tamara’s voice, literal years of daily dedicated listening and realizing now that she, like many zionist therapists and meditation instructors, has conveniently severed herself from humanity by choosing a racist ethnostate that is currently, painfully obliterating the native palestinian population. how many western therapists have you seen actually speak about this active genocide the last 2 years that we’ve all been seeing live? it’s spiritual bypassing which in this case is a green light for settler colonial violence. all zionists have a broken soul because they pick and choose who deserves humanity and who does not. since deleting the app, i’ve needed to heal myself from what is now an eerie zionist voice stuck in my memory. i definitely don’t recommend listening to tamara levitt unless you want your panic attacks soothed by a zionist. traumatizing, ironically.",1.0,2025-06-12 12:48:33,us,calm_apple_app_store_multi_country_filtered.csv,,,,,,,,baseline,5,Technical: App Crashing / Not Opening,Technical Performance,0

Lu2cool4u,"i have had this app since i had my first baby (who is now 4.5). it’s been great. i’ve used it with the sonos for white noise and bedtime stories for the kids - they love the minions ones! however, recently the sonos integration stopped working which means you can only airplay which is not as good. also they’ve stopped doing the classic tale sleep stories (by famous authors) and instead have a lot of their own stories which - while dull enough to kill one to sleep when tired, just aren’t quality enough to capture the imagination in a way that helps the story work its magic and fall asleep. i will probably cancel my subscription soon as i’m only using it for one bedtime story and the white noise!",3.0,2025-01-21 12:05:50,gb,calm_apple_app_store_multi_country_filtered.csv,,,,,,,,baseline,22,Issues with Sleep Content,Content-Specific Issues,1

Trilingual2007,"i started meditating nearly 10 years ago and i remember using the free guided meditations available on this app. at the time this was great support as i had no idea how to meditate or what it was about. i did not need to sign up to a paid subscription as the few free samples, combined with the headspace free recordings, and some other free youtube videos of jon kabat, were enough to get my practice started.
since then, i have been to in person courses through the years, such as an 8 weeks mindfulness based on cognitive therapy, self compassion mediation workshop and a silent retreat in the buddhist centre gaia house in devon (which i highly recommend). 
i signed up to the calm paid subscription in november so to make sure that i would keep up with daily meditation by using all the different guided meditation series such as ‘relationship with self or others’, ‘managing emotions / habits / difficulties at work’. the app has a lot of fancy pictures and sounds option, yet the function to save or create your own meditations list is very poor. the quantity over quality seems to have been prioritised. in fact all series start from scratch with basic concepts such as focus on breathing with no other development tools after a while, which are no use for someone who wants to progress with deeper meditation skills. 
there is also far too much talking in most of them, for instance you are given an instruction to observe your body sensations whilst recalling a certain situation but you have no time at all to explore it as a few seconds later the narrator speaks again with new information / instructions. when the app asks for feedback it does not collect why you did not like a certain recording (so how can the algorithm know that it was not the topic but the too much talking that did not work for you for instance?!). i hope someone from calm will read this feedback and integrate it in future recordings as i could not find anywhere where they collected honest detailed feedback from users, which in itself is not a good sign. i will not renew, as the bell timed silent meditations are accessible for free and the quality of the guided ones under the paid subscription is not good enough, i suggest you stay away too if not new to meditation. i will try sam harris app next (waking up), as he is a neuroscientist, so hoping to get more out of it.",2.0,2025-01-05 03:09:37,gb,calm_apple_app_store_multi_country_filtered.csv,,,,,,,,baseline,1,Meditation Content Issues,Content-Specific Issues,1

Transparency & Fairnes Pls.,"undecided as to the true value of the app so far…. but it seems likely that many, if not all, current/potential subscribers would appreciate being notified before you take their money for renewing a subscription. 

doing so without notice is unlikely to promote calmness… 

nor is the realisation that you appear to charge a vast range of prices for the same premium subscription - particularly anyone who has paid double (or even triple) the price of the lowest available subscription for what appears to be the same access.

Tagteam357,"calm is my number 1 favourite app. it has been for many years. i have been recommending it to everyone. however, in the past 6 months , it seems that the app has been bugged as it keeps crushing. 
it was very difficult to find where i can leave feedback in the website, contact someone or seek a solution to this problem. 
at the end i found two troubleshooting tips, neither of which work. it is so counterintuitive to want to relax and do your daily meditation when the app keeps on crushing! i end up frustrated and infuriated.

imagine you were an insomniac and you had a whole mountain of student 
loans money to pay off and you couldn’t sleep at all so you get your phone out and you go on the app store and search for ‘free sleep apps’ and the first one is ‘calm’ which is apparently ‘free’ so you download it and plan to have a story read to you by david walliams but you notice the small padlock in the corner of the story and you still went ahead and clicked on it and it said that you need a free trial and a subscription uh no. hello?? who do you think i am?? made of money?? and especially during the hard times here in the uk 🇬🇧 with all the prices rising and people on the absolute brink of living in poverty.

cons - i find tamara’s voice grating, and cannot tolerate listening to her content, her voice is too loud and harsh. her content is good, as i’ve tried listening to her stuff, but she needs to soften her voice and be more soothing/gentle so that you can appreciate the content. the search function is poor. accessing favs is not user friendly

a series about living with serous illness would be helpful. an updated pain series would be helpful, 

a lot of your topics are  too happy, too fake, too repetitive, people have real problems and need real help. it would be good if you has some teachers that were brave enough to get into it. i have been meditating for ten years, give us more advanced stuff, be braver! 

it is also disappointing to see you attempting to profit so much from  mental health. i know u have to make a buck, but your price is too high, it use to be reasonable, now it isn’t. cut us some slack, what about 5 year price? or a discount for long term customers, i have been using this app on and off since u started. i am at the point now where i don’t really need the app, i can meditate without it and i will. but i i enjoy it. however i am sick and on a fixed income and will soon be priced out of even your sale rates. thanks

and on the whole i now feel, calm is not so much providing various wellness tools for whatever each person may need - but instead focused now on getting people addicted to make calm a daily habit by counting streaks and highlighting a wellness score based on which elements of the app i haven’t used. this is annoying.
