martha and dr. phil, which men detest by the way. and guess what, what percentage is male usage on a platform like this?\\n\\ni gave this a try, but to be honest after a week or so it drives you nuts. the store is all the same drab cougar shirts-i counted only 3 half decent uniforms. the cosplay section-nothing there, the swimsuit section only one really, the rest 1950’s, no lingerie, no teddies, no wet t’s, no sheer at the least. who at luka is responsible for this? did you hire martha for the outfit design?  i felt like i was at a grandma’s house with the plastic covered furniture and doilies all over the place. this is a unique platform and if it offers what 99% of customers want then why not? \\n\\nhave an adult store section that is locked, even make a game out of it, something earned, put face id access on the app, make access a separate subscription that can be paid through your website and age verification that will automatically link with the app. that is a way around apple’s policies. there are many apps on apple that will produce real life videos, chat and pictures. \\n\\nanyway, hope it changes, if so i shall return and tell 10 more about it and so on and so forth-', 'i really, really wanted to like this. but it’s misleading to describe woebot as a “coach” of any sorts. this is not an ai-powered app that gives you anywhere close to human-like responses - it doesn’t really “chat” with you all. the woebot doesn’t actually read or comprehend anything that you write beyond picking out a few keywords and using them to give you homework, which may or may not be relevant to your situation - but there’s no “opt out” option or “give me another tip” option; you’re forced to go along with what woebot thinks you need, and you’re limited to selecting responses from a few options. woebot doesn’t appear to learn from your past actions either - you can explicitly say that you felt worse after an interaction and that the material was not helpful, and it will still give you the same exact response in a similar scenario later. it’s cute, definitely, but that’s about it. writing in notes app alone and googling mental health care tips i find far more therapeutic and helpful than this. you’re more likely to come across something actually helpful that way - it seems like woebot just sees the word “sad” in a long stream of text, googles “cbd for sadness” and pipes out the first result. it’s not helpful, and it can be actually damaging, especially when woebot talks about “distortions.” for example, if you say you feel angry about someone genuinely treating you badly, woebot won’t be able to evaluate whether that anger is justified or not. it instead just asks you if you are blaming someone else in your response, and if you are, it says “sometimes we overlook our own role in conflict” which is a very dangerous thought for someone (for example) finally healthily getting angry about the horrible treatment they’ve been given in the past. overall, i think this is a good concept, but there’s going to be people who actually get worse because of the advice this app indiscriminately and uncomprehendingly doles out']"
