   "source": "# Deep Dive Analysis: User Complaints in Conversational AI Apps\n\n**Milestone 3: Data Analysis**\n\nThis notebook conducts a comprehensive analysis of over 20,000 negative user reviews for leading conversational AI apps (Replika, Wysa, etc.). Our goal is to move beyond simple complaints and build a deep, data-driven understanding of *why* these products fail to meet user expectations.\n\n**Our Multi-Layered Analysis Plan:**\n1.  **Theme Discovery:** Use the state-of-the-art BERTopic model to identify the core themes of user dissatisfaction.\n2.  **Quantitative Analysis:** Visualize the frequency and emotional impact of these themes.\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis:** Validate our findings with real user reviews.\n4.  **Temporal Analysis:** Track how these complaint themes have evolved over time to understand the impact of real-world events."
