# Communication Strategy

## Goal

The goal of this phase is not just to "publish" but to ensure our findings
reach the people who can act on them.
This document outlines a proposed strategy to maximize our impact. It details
who our target audiences are, how we can reach them, and a concrete action plan.

## The Core Artifact: Our Medium Article

(link should be added here later)  

Our primary communication artifact will be our Medium article. This format is
perfect for our target audiences because it is:  

- **Accessible:** Readable by both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- **Shareable:** Easily distributed on social and professional networks.  
- **Credible:** Allows us to link directly to our GitHub repository and Kaggle
dataset, demonstrating the rigor behind our findings.

## The Thought Process: Who Are We Trying to Reach?

Our project is interdisciplinary, so our outreach should be too. A targeted
approach will be more effective than a broad one. Here are the key communities
we should focus on:  

### Primary Audience 1: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Researchers

**Why?** Our "Public Failure Analysis" methodology is a strong example of
real-world user experience research. They will be interested in how we did our
work.  
**Value to them:** Provides a model for evaluating social technologies using
public data.  

### Primary Audience 2: Digital Mental Health & Clinical Psychology Researchers

**Why?** This community is deeply concerned with patient safety and efficacy.
Our findings on crisis intervention failures and psychological harm provide
crucial real-world evidence for their work.  
**Value to them:** Hard data to support calls for better regulation and
clinical validation of mental health apps.  

### Primary Audience 3: AI & NLP Ethics Researchers

**Why?** Our project is a perfect case study on the unintended consequences of
social AI. The themes of unhealthy dependency and user betrayal are central to
their field.  
**Value to them:** A real-world example of the ethical complexities of
designing parasocial (human-AI) relationships.  

### Strategic Audience: Graduate Students and Postdocs

**Why?** They are the next generation of researchers, highly active online,  
and eager to cite and build upon impactful work. They could become our
project’s strongest advocates.  
**Value to them:** A resource they can reference and extend in their own
research.  

### Secondary Audience: Users, product managers & developers

**Why?** Our article highlights failures in mental health apps, and combined
with the communication milestone research, it provides practical insights for
both end-users and industry professionals.  
**Value to them:** Best practices and advice for safe use and responsible
development of mental health technologies.

## The Action Plan: A Multi-Tiered Outreach Strategy

Based on our target audiences, here is a proposed three-tiered strategy to get
our work noticed.  

### Tier 1: Broad Digital Dissemination (Getting the Word Out)

This is our foundational step to make the work discoverable.  

- **Action Item 1:** Publish on Medium.  
- **Action Item 2:** Share on Social & Professional Networks.  
  - **Twitter/X:** We will create a thread summarizing our key findings. We
  should include our best visuals, tag relevant labs/researchers, and use
  strategic hashtags (#HCI, #DigitalHealth, #AIEthics).  
  - **LinkedIn:** We will post a professional summary, framing it as a case
  study in ethical product design. We should tag the companies involved
  (Wysa, Calm, Replika) to increase visibility.  
- **Action Item 3:** Make our notebook on Kaggle publicly available. We will
publish our master analysis notebook in the "Code" section of our Kaggle
dataset. This showcases our technical rigor to the data
science community.  

### Tier 2: Targeted Academic Outreach (The Direct Approach)

- **Action Item 4:** Identify Key Researchers.  
  We will collaboratively build a small, targeted list of ~15-20 researchers
  (focusing on Assistant Professors, Postdocs, and PhD students) who have
  published relevant work in the last 2-3 years.
  Search terms: "mental health chatbot ethics," "user experience of
  conversational AI," "digital therapeutics evaluation."  

- **Action Item 5:** Draft and Send Respectful Outreach Messages  
**Goal:** Connect with researchers on our list by sharing our findings in a
concise and respectful way. Outreach will be done via email and LinkedIn
messages.  

  **Approach:**  
  - **Email:** Use the provided template for a short
  respectful message highlighting why our work is relevant to their research.  
  - **LinkedIn:** Adapt the same message into a brief LinkedIn connection
  request + follow-up message. Keep it even shorter (2–3 sentences),
  pointing to our Medium article and expressing genuine interest in their
  work.  

  **Email Template:**

      Subject:

      Quick question re: your work on chatbot empathy & our new analysis
      
      Body:

      Dear Dr. [Last Name],

      My name is [Our Name], and I'm part of the DataCure research team from the
      MIT Emerging Talent program. We found your recent paper, "[Title of Their
      Paper]," incredibly insightful as we conducted our own research.

      Our project was a large-scale "public failure analysis" of mental health
      chatbots, based on over 30,000 user reviews. We identified a set of
      critical ethical risks, from failures in crisis intervention to the psychological
      harm caused by sudden AI personality changes.

      Given your expertise in this area, we thought you might find our findings
      and proposed ethical framework interesting. We've summarized our work in a
      Medium article here: [Link].
      
      No obligation to respond, but we would be honored to hear your thoughts if
      you have a moment.
      
      Thank you for your time and your important contributions to the field.

      Best regards,  
      The DataCure Team

  **LinkedIn Message:**

      Hello Dr. [Last Name],

      I’m part of the DataCure research team from MIT’s Emerging Talent program.
      We recently analyzed 30,000+ user reviews of mental health chatbots and 
      identified key ethical risks.

      We summarized our findings in a Medium article: [Link].
      I’d love to connect and hear your perspective on this important issue.

### Tier 3: Formal Academic Engagement (The Long Game)

This is an optional but highly recommended step to ensure our project has a
lasting impact in the research community.  

- **Action Item 6 (Optional):** Submit to a Pre-print Server. We can post a
more formally structured version of our article to arXiv or PsyArXiv. This
makes our work officially citable.  
- **Action Item 7 (Optional):** Submit to a Conference. Our work is strong
enough for a "Work-in-Progress" or "Poster" submission at a top conference
like ACM CHI or CSCW. This would be a fantastic way to share our findings
and get feedback from leading experts.
