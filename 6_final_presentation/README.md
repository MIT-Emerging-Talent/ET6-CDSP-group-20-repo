## Summary of Our Research

  In this project, we explored how users emotionally experience mental health
  chat-bots and what happens when support falls short. Our research aimed to
  understand whether chatbot-generated reviews are perceived differently by users
  compared to human-generated ones.

### Key Findings

- **User Engagement**: Chatbot-generated reviews often receive higher engagement
  metrics, such as upvotes and responses, compared to human-generated reviews.  
- **Perception of Authenticity**: Users perceive chatbot-generated reviews as
  less authentic, which can affect trust and engagement.  
- **Impact on App Ratings**: The presence of chatbot-generated reviews can
  influence app ratings, potentially affecting visibility and user acquisition.

## Research Approach

Our methodology included:

- **Data Collection**: Scraping reviews from Google Play Store,
  Apple App Store, and Reddit.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring collected data.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using NLP to assess review sentiment.  
- **Engagement Metrics Analysis**: Evaluating user interactions with reviews.

## Limitations

- **Data Bias**: Certain types of reviews are more prevalent, introducing
  bias.  
- **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**: Sarcasm and nuanced language can affect
  sentiment detection.  
- **Platform Differences**: Review formats and user behavior differ across
  platforms.

## Future Research Directions

- **Longitudinal Studies**: Observe trends and changes in user behavior over
  time.  
- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Compare engagement patterns across different
  platforms.  
- **Enhanced Sentiment Analysis**: Improve models to detect complex sentiments
  accurately.

## Communication Strategy

  Our communication strategy focused on effectively presenting our findings to
  both technical and non-technical audiences. We used visual aids, data
  visualizations, and concise narratives. Additionally, we published a
  Medium article to share our insights with a broader audience.
