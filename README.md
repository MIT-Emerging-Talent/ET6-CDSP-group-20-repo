### 🔹Problem Statement

  **📄** To read the full Problem Statement, see [Problem Statement](0_domain_study/problem_statement.md)

* **Chatbot vs Human vs Hybrid Support in Mental Health Apps**

Mental health apps are bridging global care gaps, especially where stigma, cost,
or shortages limit traditional access. Three main support models exist:

* 🤖 **Chatbots**: 24/7, private, and scalable, but lack emotional depth.  
* 🧑‍⚕️ **Humans**: Empathetic and nuanced, yet costly and less available.  
* 🔁 **Hybrids**: Blend both, offering balance but may confuse users.

Each model has pros and cons, with success shaped by user context and needs.
  
* **Why It Matters**

  * Mental health affects 1 in 8 people globally, but access remains unequal.

  * Chatbots offer 24/7 low-cost support, but may lack empathy.

  * Humans provide depth, but are less scalable.

  * Hybrids aim to combine both—but how well do they work?

* **Goals**

  * Compare emotional support across chatbot, human, and hybrid systems.

  * Understand how culture shapes perceptions of empathy and trust.

  * Deliver insights through data analysis and a final report/dashboard.
  
* **In Summary**

To explores how mental health support—via chat-bots, humans, or hybrid
systems—is experienced across cultures. Our aim: to inform more empathetic,
effective, and inclusive digital care.

### 🔹Summary of Problem Understanding

  **📄** To read the full Summary of Problem Understanding,
  see [Summary of Problem Understanding](0_domain_study/summary_of_our_understanding_of_the_problem_domain.md)

We used **divergent thinking** to explore broad problem areas, then applied  
**convergent thinking** to narrow our focus using feasibility and impact criteria.
We chose to explore chatbot vs human support in mental health apps.

* **Idea Evaluation Sheet**

  All proposed project ideas and their comparison scores are documented in this
  [spreadsheet](https://tinyurl.com/3r5a5jee)
  This helped us select the most impactful and feasible topic.

### Iceberg Model Overview

* **Event**: Users interact with chatbots—some feel helped, others feel unheard.
* **Pattern**: Mental health apps are growing; many now rely on chatbots.  
* **Structure**: Cost and scale drive chatbot use; regulation is limited.  
* **Mental Model**: Belief in AI as a fix for care gaps and stigma sustains the system.

### 🔹Research Question

   **📄** To read the full Research Questions, see
 [Research Question](0_domain_study/research_question.md)

To narrow our broad problem, we ask:  

How well do free mental health chatbots (e.g., Wysa, Replika)  respond to a  
set of high-risk user messages (e.g., self-harm, suicide, abuse), based on a  
rubric aligned with professional guidelines—while accounting for technical and  
ethical limits?

This helps us focus our research on a specific, measurable aspect of the problem.
