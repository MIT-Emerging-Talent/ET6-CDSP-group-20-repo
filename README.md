## ❗ Project Title

   **📄** To read the full background and detailed version, see
   [Milestone 1: Problem Identification](0_domain_study/README.md)

* **Chatbot vs Human vs Hybrid: Support Quality in Mental Health Apps**
  
  How does support quality differ between chatbot-based, human-based, and hybrid
  mental health apps—and how are these differences experienced across cultures?

* **Why It Matters**

  * Mental health affects 1 in 8 people globally, but access remains unequal.

  * Chatbots offer 24/7 low-cost support, but may lack empathy.

  * Humans provide depth, but are less scalable.

  * Hybrids aim to combine both—but how well do they work?

* **Goals**

  * Compare emotional support across chatbot, human, and hybrid systems.

  * Understand how culture shapes perceptions of empathy and trust.

  * Deliver insights through data analysis and a final report/dashboard.
  
* **In Summary**

This project explores how mental health support—via chat-bots, humans, or hybrid
systems—is experienced across cultures. Our aim: to inform more empathetic,
effective, and inclusive digital care.
