## ❗ Problem Statement

* **Chatbot vs Human vs Hybrid: Support Quality in Mental Health Apps**
  
  How does support quality differ between chatbot-based, human-based, and hybrid
  mental health apps—and how are these differences experienced across cultures?

* **Background & Motivation**

  Mental health affects 1 in 8 people worldwide (WHO), yet access remains
  limited in many regions due to cost, stigma, and lack of professionals.
  Digital apps have stepped in, offering:

  * Chat-bots: 24/7 support, low cost, but often impersonal

  * Humans: Deeper empathy, but limited availability

  * Hybrids: A blend of both—potentially scalable and warm

  As a culturally diverse team, we’ve experienced the strengths and limitations
  of all three.
  **This raises key questions:**
  1. Are users truly being supported—or just being managed?
  2. How do cultural norms shape perceptions of empathy and trust?

* **Why It Matters**

  * Timely: AI mental health tools are booming, but emotional effectiveness is
    under explored

  * Culturally Grounded: Empathy looks different across cultures—especially in
    hybrid models

  * Feasible: We’ll analyze app reviews, chatbot simulations, surveys, and
    research using Python, NLP, and visualization tools

  * Personal: Our team is deeply invested in mental health and tech

  * Original: Few studies compare all three models across regions

* **Goals**

  Compare support quality in chatbot, human, and hybrid systems

  Explore cultural differences in how support is perceived

  Deliver a report, dashboard, or case study to inform app design and
  ethical AI practices

* **In Summary**

This project explores how mental health support—via chat-bots, humans, or hybrid
systems—is experienced across cultures. Our aim: to inform more empathetic,
effective, and inclusive digital care.
