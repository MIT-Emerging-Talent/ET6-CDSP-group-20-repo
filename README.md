# ET6 Collaborative Data Science Project – Group 20

[![CI Status](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-20-repo/actions/workflows/ci-checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-20-repo/actions/workflows/ci-checks.yml)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our MIT Emerging Talent 2025 Collaborative
Data Science Project.

Our project investigates how data science, empathy, and cultural perspectives
intersect to address real-world challenges.

We are currently in **Milestone 1: Problem Identification**, where we’re
narrowing our research focus and laying the foundation for a reproducible,
collaborative data science workflow.

## 👋 Meet the Team

We are **DataCure 🧬**, a globally distributed team brought together by a shared
commitment to mental health equity.  
Each of us contributes diverse skills, lived experiences, and regional knowledge
to explore how digital technologies can better support emotional well-being.

Throughout this journey, we aim to:

- Strengthen our collaboration in a cross-cultural, remote environment
- Explore real-world data science methods applied to human-centered problems
- Deliver insights that are inclusive, ethical, and actionable

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Digital mental health platforms are increasingly stepping in to address a global
care gap, with 1 in 8 people worldwide living with a mental health condition
many unable to access traditional support due to cost, stigma, or workforce
shortages. In many low-resource or culturally conservative contexts, these apps
often serve as the first—and sometimes only—source of emotional support.

We focus on three support models:

- 🤖 **Chatbot-based support**: AI-driven conversational agents providing
automated, always-on interaction
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Human-based support**: Therapists, coaches, or peer listeners offering
empathetic live interaction
- 🔁 **Hybrid models**: Systems combining both, e.g. chatbot triage followed by
human escalation

Our research explores how users from different cultural regions experience these
support systems in terms of empathy, trust, and satisfaction—and which factors
make one model more effective than the others.
