# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- These are limitations that come from outside our team and are beyond our control.

- Course Deadlines: All milestone deliverables must be submitted according to the
  dates defined by the ET6 CDSP syllabus (e.g., Milestone 0 by June 2, Milestone
  1 by June 16, etc.).

- Data Access & Licensing: Some datasets may be behind paywalls or require
  special permissions. We must ensure any public data we use is open-license and
  properly cited.

- Internet Connectivity: Some members' intermittent connectivity can slow down
  large data downloads, real-time collaboration, or pulling/pushing to GitHub.

- GitHub Actions Quota: Our CI/CD pipeline (md_lint, pytest, flake8) is subject
  to GitHub Actions usage quotas. If we hit those limits, automated checks may
  fail or be delayed.

- Required Technologies: The course may specify or strongly recommend certain
  technologies (e.g., Python for backend development, specific libraries) that
  we must use.

- Security Compliance: If applicable, the project must adhere to general data
  handling best practices and any specific security requirements for educational
  projects.

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

   These constraints originate from within our team but are not something we can
   directly change for this project.

- Team Membersâ€™ Work & Academic Duties: Some members are currently working
  full-time/part-time or have ongoing coursework. Their availability may
  unexpectedly drop due to work commitments, emergencies, or exams.

- Skill Gaps: Not everyone has the same level of experience with Git,
  Python/R, or statistical methods. This can slow down code development or
  require extra time for peer teaching.

- Language Barriers: While we use English as our primary language to discuss
  misunderstandings can arise if instructions or code comments are not written
  clearly for all language backgrounds.

- Available Time: Beyond specific work/academic duties, the general amount of
  time each team member can dedicate to the project per week is a fixed resource.

- Hardware Limitations: Our development machines have specific hardware
  configurations that could impact local build times and the ability to
  run certain simulations.

  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

   These are limitations we've decided on as a team to help manage and scope the
   project effectively.

- Adherence to Agile Workflow: We choose to follow a lightweight Agile process
  (branch-per-task, weekly sprints, PR reviews). By agreeing to that, each
  member commits to create issues, submit PRs, and participate in stand-ups.

- Code of Conduct & Collaborative Etiquette: We voluntarily agree to maintain
  respectful communication (no harassment, timely code reviews, constructive
  feedback) in Slack/Discord, GitHub Comments, and video calls.

- Continuous Learning & Knowledge Sharing: Team members have agreed to teach one
  another (e.g., a Git tutorial, a short Python lesson) to bridge skill gaps.
  This is not mandatory but is part of our collaborative spirit.

- Open Documentation: We choose to document every step (data sources, cleaning
  decisions, analysis approach) in README files so that any future researcher can
  reproduce our work.

- Coding Style and Conventions: We've agreed to adhere to a consistent coding style
  (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) to ensure code readability and maintainability across
  the project.

- Minimum Test Coverage: We will aim for a minimum percentage of unit test
  coverage (e.g., 70% or 80%) for all new code to ensure robustness.

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
