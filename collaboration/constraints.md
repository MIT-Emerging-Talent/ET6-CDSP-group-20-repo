# Constraints

- **Available Data**: Access to real chat logs is limited due to privacy and data
  ownership concerns, impacting dataset availability for analysis.
- **Domain Expertise**: Evaluating support quality requires clinical psychology
  expertise, which our team may lack.
- **CS/DS Expertise**: Building NLP models (e.g., sentiment analysis) demands
  strong DS/ML skills, challenging for some team members.
- **Remote Async Collaboration**: Asynchronous work across time zones creates
  communication and coordination challenges.
- **Milestone Pacing**: Balancing deliverable quality with fixed deadlines risks
  rushed outputs.
- **Evaluation Criteria Ambiguity**: Defining "quality" in mental health support
  (e.g., empathy, accuracy, response time) remains unclear.

## Next Steps

- Discuss potential solutions or mitigations for each constraint.
- Identify resources (e.g., public datasets, expert consultations) to address
  limitations.
- Propose evaluation criteria for "quality" in mental health support.
