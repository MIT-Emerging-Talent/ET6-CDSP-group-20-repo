Begin working on **Milestone 1** of the Collaborative Data Science Project.  
**Goal:** Select a specific, real-world problem to study as a team.

---

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Problem Idea Proposals

Each member was asked to bring 1–2 real-world problems they care about
 (e.g., healthcare access, education barriers, misinformation, climate impacts).

To guide brainstorming, we considered:

- **Impact** – Who does this affect? Is it meaningful?
- **Feasibility** – Is relevant data available (e.g., Kaggle, World Bank)?
- **Relevance** – Does it connect to our team’s diverse backgrounds?

📌 Suggested format for posting in Slack:
> **Problem:** Farmers lose crops due to droughts  
> **Impact:** Food insecurity  
> **Data:** Climate records

### 2. Individual Pitches (3–5 mins each)

Team members pitched their ideas using the **Iceberg Model**
 from the Collaborative DS Project (pp. 10–12), covering:

- **Event** – What’s happening?  
- **Trends** – What patterns exist?  
- **Systems** – What structures or barriers contribute?  
- **Beliefs** – What cultural/social assumptions are involved?

Each person answered:

- Why is this problem important?
- Who is affected (e.g., a specific user like “Maria, a farmer”)?
- How could we study it?
