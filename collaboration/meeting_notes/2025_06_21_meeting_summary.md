# Meeting Summary ‚Äì June 21, 2025  

## Purpose  

To reflect on the current project scope and challenges, and plan refinements
 to ensure feasibility within the CDSP timeline.

---

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. ‚úÖ Strong Core Idea  

- The team reaffirmed that the selected topic ‚Äî  
  **"Evaluating Support Quality in Mental Health Apps"**
   ‚Äî is highly relevant and meaningful.  
- Team members expressed strong motivation and alignment around the core problem.

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: Project Scope  

- The current project plan is **too ambitious** for the 12-week CDSP timeline.
- Completing all milestones as planned would be extremely difficult.

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Specific Areas of Concern

#### a. Data Collection  

- Original plan included:
  - Chatbot simulations  
  - App store reviews  
  - Cross-cultural surveys  
  - Human-led support system analysis  
- This is **not feasible** within a 2-week data collection window.

#### b. Ethical Complexity  

- Using high-risk prompts (e.g., self-harm disclosures)
introduces serious ethical concerns.
- Time required for proper ethical approval and
risk mitigation is beyond the course scope.

#### c. Overly Broad Research Question  

- Comparing **chatbots vs. humans vs. hybrid systems**
simultaneously spreads the project too thin.

---

## ‚úÖ Agreed Next Step

- The **top priority** is to **refine the research question and project scope**:
  - Narrow the focus to a specific and manageable angle.
  - Ensure feasibility within the 12-week schedule.

- Each team member should:
  - Propose a **refined version of the research question**.
  - Outline a **clear and practical data collection methodology**
   for their proposed focus.
  - Include a brief **feasibility assessment** for their refinement.
