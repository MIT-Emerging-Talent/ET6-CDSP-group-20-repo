# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Delaying initial task assignments—we lost early momentum.
- Assuming everyone understood GitHub workflows—needed more onboarding.
- Scheduling meetings without confirming time zones for all members.

## Continue Doing

- Weekly check-ins and async updates via Slack worked well.
- Rotating roles (facilitator, note-taker) helped balance responsibility.

## Start Doing

- Create a shared timezone chart to avoid confusion.
- Use GitHub Projects’ automation features to track progress better.

## Lessons Learned

- Cross-cultural collaboration requires patience and clarity.
- It's important to define and revisit group norms regularly.
- Setting up the repo with templates and protections early saves time.
