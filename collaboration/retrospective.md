# Retrospective for Milestone 0

> “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.”  
> — Henry Ford

## ✅ What Went Well

- **Helping Each Other**: When one got stuck, someone else stepped in.  
  That teamwork made a huge difference.

## ⚠️ What Can Be Better

- **Be More Prepared**: Let’s come to meetings ready—review the board,  
  check PRs, and know what’s next.

- **Use the Project Board**: It's our map. We need to update it regularly  
  and use labels clearly.

- **Set Clear Deadlines**: Having a timeline keeps us all on track and  
  reduces last-minute stress.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Know the Deliverables**: Before each meeting, let’s be clear about  
  what’s due and what’s done.

- **Define Roles Early**: Decide who’s doing what from the beginning.

- **Be Honest About Skills**: If someone needs help, say so early—  
  we’ll figure it out together.
