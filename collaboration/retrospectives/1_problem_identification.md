# Retrospective â€“ Milestone 1: Problem Identification

## What Went Well (Continue Doing)

- **Collaborative Brainstorming and Decision-Making**: We excelled in
  divergent and convergent thinking.
  Initially, each team member shared mental health and tech-related problems
  they cared about during a dedicated meeting. We then used an evaluation
  matrix to score and rank ideas, narrowing down to three options.
  After discussing constraints, we selected a well-scoped, actionable problem
  aligned with our goals.
- **Clear Communication Plan**: Regular video meetings ensured collaborative
  decision-making. For members unable to attend, we shared concise summaries to
  keep everyone informed. Despite early time zone challenges,
  we agreed on mutually convenient meeting times.
- **Effective Role Assignment**: Assigning tasks at the end of each meeting
  clarified responsibilities, enabling efficient parallel work on deliverables.

## What Could Be Improved (Stop Doing)

- **Overextended Ideation**: Spending too much time exploring numerous
  problems delayed our focus on deliverables, rushing the final stages of the milestone.
- **Document Organization Issues**: Sharing documents via Slack led to
  disorganization as the project grew, making it hard to locate files.

## What to Try Next (Start Doing)

- **Set Decision Deadlines Early**: Establish earlier deadlines for key decisions
  to allocate more time for refining deliverables.
- **Centralized Document Organization**: Create a shared Google Drive folder to
  streamline access to drafts and collaborative documents, reducing reliance on Slack.

## Lessons Learned

- **Structured Decision-Making Enhances Clarity**: Using divergent and convergent
  thinking, supported by an evaluation matrix, allowed us to objectively select a
  focused problem (e.g., improving mental health app accessibility) from a broad
  set of ideas.
- **Remote Communication Requires Intentionality**: Regular video meetings, clear
  summaries for absentees, and time zone adjustments fostered strong collaboration
  in a remote setting.
- **Clear Roles Drive Efficiency**: Assigning responsibilities at the end of meetings
  ensured steady progress on deliverables.
- **Early Scoping Saves Time**: Prolonged ideation rushed our deliverables.
  Setting earlier decision deadlines will improve future milestones.
- **Centralized Tools Improve Organization**: Slack alone was insufficient for
  document management. A shared Google Drive folder will enhance file accessibility
  and organization.
