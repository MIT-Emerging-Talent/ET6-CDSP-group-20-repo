## Individual Retrospectives

### Ayham

#### What I Did Right

- Helped the team navigate an ambiguous milestone that we had little prior  
knowledge about, providing structure and direction.  
- Wrote a Medium article as our communication artifact, introducing a new  
narrative that focused on the ethical and safety aspects of AI in mental  
health. While this built on the team’s prior analysis, the fresh angle helped  
diversify our audience.  
- Encouraged team involvement throughout the process: starting from the blank  
page draft to each new addition, I kept the team informed and invited input  
so everyone had a chance to contribute.  

#### What I Could Have Done Differently

- I could have enhanced the article further with refinements and improvements.  
However, with the deadline approaching and the nature of this fast-paced  
learning project, I prioritized publishing in a timely manner.  

### Aziz Azizi

I feel confident in how we communicated the results of this milestone. The
findings were not only supported by analysis but also presented in a way that
was clear and relevant to the intended audience. For me, this was the first
time I focused less on just “getting results” and more on ensuring that others
could understand and use them.

- What Went Well:

  - I improved in simplifying technical results into practical messages.

  - I collaborated with the team to ensure our Medium
    article/readme/documentation was cohesive and clear.

- Areas for Improvement

  - I could improve in tailoring communication to different audiences (e.g.,
  technical peers vs. general readers).

  - I sometimes focused too much on details and had to remind myself to
    prioritize clarity over completeness.

  - I need to practice giving and receiving feedback on drafts more actively,
    as this strengthens the final communication.

### **Huda**

#### What I did

- I collected and organized the audience list.
- I helped with an extra layer of research shaping advice and best practices.  
- I learned to see communication as an essential part of the research process.  

#### Improvements

- I could have expanded and refined the audience list to be more comprehensive.
- I could have taken on more tasks to contribute more broadly to this milestone.

**Key Takeaway:**  
I learned how to turn research into something practical and useful in real work.
