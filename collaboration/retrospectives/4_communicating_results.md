### Individual Retrospectives

- **Ayham:**

**What I Did Right**  

- Helped the team navigate an ambiguous milestone that we had little prior  
knowledge about, providing structure and direction.  
- Wrote a Medium article as our communication artifact,  
introducing a new narrative that focused on the ethical  
and safety aspects of AI in mental health. While this built on the  
team’s prior analysis,the fresh angle helped diversify our audience.  

- Encouraged team involvement throughout the process:  
starting from the blank page draft to each new addition,  
I kept the team informed and invited input  
so everyone had a chance to contribute.  

**What I Could Have Done Differently**  

- I could have enhanced the article further with refinements and improvements.  
However, with the deadline approaching and the  
nature of this fast-paced learning project, I
prioritized publishing on a timely manner.
