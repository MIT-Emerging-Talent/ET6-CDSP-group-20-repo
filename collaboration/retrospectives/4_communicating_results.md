# **Milestone 4: Communicating Results**

## ðŸŒ± **Team Growth**

This phase really pushed us to think beyond just being researchers.
We had to put ourselves in the shoes of communicators and strategists.
We realized that doing the analysis is only half the job â€” the real impact
comes when the right people actually hear about it and can act on it.  

As a team, we learned how to:  

- Be more intentional about who weâ€™re trying to reach and how we reach them.  
- Use different platforms together â€” Medium for accessibility, GitHub/Kaggle
for technical credibility, and LinkedIn/Twitter for visibility.  
- See our work as part of a bigger conversation between researchers
practitioners, and the public.

## **What Went Well**

- We mapped our audiences clearly and built a structured outreach plan.  
- We created strong email and LinkedIn templates that can be reused in the future.
- We tied everything together â€” Medium article for visibility, GitHub + Kaggle for
rigor.

## **What Could Be Improved**

- We didnâ€™t set up ways to measure success (views, shares, responses) â€” we
should add that next time.  
- Our researcher list was a good start, but it was too small. Expanding it
would give us more feedback and connections.  
- A follow-up strategy would help us keep conversations going after the first
contact.

**In short:** This milestone showed us that research doesnâ€™t end when the
analysis is done â€” it only has real value when itâ€™s shared in the right way
with the right people.

## **Individual Reflection â€“ Huda**

In this milestone, my main contribution was collecting and organizing the list
of audiences we should focus on.  

I also helped shape the extra layer of research that turned our findings into
practical advice for both users and the industry community.  

This experience taught me how important it is to think about communication as
part of the research process.  

**What I took away most was learning how to turn research into something
useful in practice.**
