# Final Presentation

## Analyzing Failures in Mental Health Chat-bots

  This presentation delves into the limitations of current chatbot technologies,
  particularly in emotionally sensitive contexts. It examines user expectations,
  identifies existing gaps, and raises critical ethical questions about the
  reliance on AI for mental health support.

### Reflection

  Embarking on this project was both challenging and enlightening. The process
  of translating complex research into a coherent narrative honed my skills in
  critical thinking and communication. I learned to anticipate audience
  questions and address them proactively, ensuring the presentation was not only
  informative but also engaging.

  One of the most significant challenges was distilling intricate ethical
  dilemmas into accessible content. This experience deepened my appreciation
  for the nuances involved in AI ethics and the importance of responsible
  development.

#### Future Directions

Moving forward, we aim to:

* Ethical Frameworks: Develop guidelines to assist developers in creating
  emotionally intelligent and ethically sound AI systems.

* User-Centric Design: Advocate for design principles that prioritize user
  well-being and trust.
