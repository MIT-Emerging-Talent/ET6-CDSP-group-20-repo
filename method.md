# Methods

This document explains the methods, tools, and processes used in our project
so that others can understand and reproduce our work.

___

## 1. Data Source

* **Dataset:** MHARD (Mental Health App Reviews Dataset) from Kaggle.

* **Focus:** Conversational mental health apps, especially Calm, compared with
other baseline apps.

* **Data format:** Play store reviews in CSV format, including review text, rating,
  and metadata.

## 2. Data Preparation

We cleaned and pre-processed the dataset before applying any analysis:

* Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries.

* Lowercased and stripped punctuation.

* Applied TF-IDF vectorization for text representation.

* Organized reviews into baseline apps vs conversational apps subsets.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis

We used **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** to analyze
sentiment of each review:

* Outputs: positive, negative, neutral, compound score.

* Compound scores were used to categorize reviews into positive, neutral,
or negative sentiment.

This helped us see how users emotionally react to chatbot support compared to baseline apps.

## 4. Topic Modeling

We used BERTopic for topic modeling:

* BERTopic builds interpretable topics using transformer embeddings + clustering.

* Each review was assigned to a topic cluster.

* Topics were named using representative keywords (e.g., AI Performance &
  Quality, Emotional Support, Privacy Concerns).

* This helped us identify major themes in user feedback.

## 5. Thematic + Emotional Fingerprint

To go beyond generic sentiment, we:

* Filtered reviews by theme (e.g., AI Performance & Quality).

* Extracted negative/highly emotional words using TF-IDF + sentiment scores.

* Built ‚ÄúEmotional Fingerprints‚Äù of negative themes (e.g., words like
  useless, fake, disappointing cluster around AI performance).

* Visualized results with word clouds and tables.

## 6. Reproducibility

* Steps are divided by folder:

  * 2_data_preparation/ ‚Üí cleaning & TF-IDF

  * 3_data_exploration/ ‚Üí VADER sentiment analysis

  * 4_data_analysis/ ‚Üí BERTopic + Emotional Fingerprint
